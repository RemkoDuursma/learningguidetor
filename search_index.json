Remko Duursma 2019-10-30 Chapter 1 Preface This book is not an introduction to statistical theory, although sometimes we repeat a little theory to be able to make sense of R output. This book should not be the first statistics book you read. Instead, this book shows you how to implement many useful data analysis routines in R. We really assume that you have already learned statistics elsewhere and are here to learn how to actually do the analyses with R. We have learned from experience that data practictioners, that means scientists and everyone else who has an interest in learning from data, do not learn statistical analyses by studying the underlying theory. They learn from doing, and from using examples written by others who have learned by doing. For this reason the book in front of you is largely a compendium of examples. We have chosen the examples and the exercises in the hope that they resemble real-world problems. We have placed many Try it yourself boxes throughout the text to give you some ideas on what to try, but try to be creative and modify the examples to see what happens. 1.1 About the author Remko Duursma is a Data Scientist and R Trainer at Shinto Labs. Previously, he was a scientist in the field of forestry and plant ecology, and studied the effects of climate change with the use of data and models. He has published nearly 70 articles in the scientific literature, and more than ten R packages. A lot of the content in this book was written when Remko was an Associate Professor at the Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment, where he taught a long-running R course together with Jeff Powell.

We occasionally give some tips on how to use Rstudio effectively, but since Rstudio is likely to change more quickly than R - we instead suggest you keep an eye on their documentation (link). We assume that you have installed both R, and Rstudio. Please visit both websites (here for R, here for Rstudio) to download the latest version for your platform. Note that Rstudio simply runs R for us (and provides many, many other features) - you still need to install R itself. Rstudio settings We strongly recommend you change the following default settings in Rstudio. The default behaviour is to save all your objects to an ‘RData’ file when you exit, and loads the same objects when you open RStudio. This is very dangerous behaviour, and you must turn it off. For now, make sure you go to Tools &gt; Global Options… and on the General tab, make sure the settings are like the figure below. Another feature you may want to turn off is the automatic code completion, which is now a standard feature in RStudio. This is a matter of taste, but we find it handier to use code completion only when requested. If you change the settings as shown in the screenshot below, you can engage code completion by typing part of a function and then pressing Tab. This text is not a complete or even comprehensive guide to Rstudio - we focus on R. If you want to know more about all the options in the menu’s, keyboard shortcuts, and various add-ons and features, please visit this link to get started. 2.1.1 Example data used throughout this book All example datasets used throughout this book are provided in the R package lgrdata. Install it like any other package (see 2.10 for more information): install.packages(&quot;lgrdata&quot;) At the start of each script where you use an example dataset, load the package: library(lgrdata) Then, you can make available any dataset from the package with : data(allometry) Each dataset has help page, inspect it (?allometry) to learn a bit about the dataset, the meaning and units of the variables, and sometimes a simple example plot with the data. To look at all datasets included in the lgrdata package, it is most convenient to use Rstudio’s package explorer, under the Packages tab in the bottom-right hand menu. Just find the package and click on it. 2.2 Basic operations In Rstudio, the R console is shown in one of the windows. The other windows include the ‘Environment’ window (with tabs ‘Environment’, ‘History’, etc.), a ‘File management’ window (where you can browse files, view plots, install packages, etc.), and a source window. The source window (containing a script where you can write and save code) may not show up on your first use of Rstudio, press Ctrl-Shift-N to open a new script. We return to scripts in Section 2.12.2. In the console, you can type R code and get immediate results, for example: # I want to add two numbers: 1 + 1 ## [1] 2 Here, we typed 1 + 1, hit Enter, and R produced 2. The [1] means that the result only has one element (the number ‘2’). In this book, the R output is shown after ##. Every example can be run by you, simply copy the section (use the text selection tool in Adobe reader), and paste it into the console (with Ctrl + Enter on a Windows machine, or Cmd + Enter on a Mac). We can do all sorts of basic calculator operations. Consider the following examples: # Arithmetic 12 * (10 + 1) ## [1] 132 # Scientific notation 3.5E03 + 4E-01 ## [1] 3500.4 # pi is a built-in constant sin(pi/2) ## [1] 1 # Absolute value abs(-10) ## [1] 10 # Yes, you can divide by zero 1001/0 ## [1] Inf # Square root sqrt(225) ## [1] 15 # Exponents 15^2 ## [1] 225 # Round down to nearest integer (and ceiling() for up or round() for closest) floor(3.1415) ## [1] 3 Try typing ?Math for description of more mathematical functions. Also note the use of # for comments: anything after this symbol on the same line is not read by R. When typing code directly into the console (other than a script, which is what you usually will do when developing more serious code), consider these tips: Press UP on your keyboard to repeat the previous command (and keep pressing UP to find all previous commands). Press TAB to auto-complete the name of a function (even those from loaded packages); very handy if you don’t remember the name of the function, or you can’t be bothered typing it in. Press CTRL-L (CMD-L on Mac) to ‘clear’ the console. This does not remove the history or any objects, just starts a fresh screen. Press ESC to cancel an operation (if R is taking long, and you don’t want to wait). 2.3 Working with vectors A very useful type of object is the vector, which is basically a string of numbers or bits of text (but not a combination of both). The power of R is that most functions can use a vector directly as input, which greatly simplifies coding in many applications. Let’s construct an example vector with 7 numbers: nums1 &lt;- c(1,4,2,8,11,100,8) We can now do basic arithmetic with this numeric vector : # Get the sum of a vector: sum(nums1) ## [1] 134 # Get mean, standard deviation, number of observations (length): mean(nums1) ## [1] 19.14286 sd(nums1) ## [1] 35.83494 length(nums1) ## [1] 7 # Some functions result in a new vector, for example: rev(nums1) # reverse elements ## [1] 8 100 11 8 2 4 1 cumsum(nums1) # cumulative sum ## [1] 1 5 7 15 26 126 134 There are many more functions you can use directly on vectors. See the table below for a few useful ones. Table 2.1: A selection of useful built-in functions in R. Function What it does Example length Length of the vector length(nums1) rev Reverses the elements of a vector rev(nums1) sort Sorts the elements of a vector sort(nums1, decreasing = TRUE) order The order of elements in a vector order(nums1) head The first few elements of a vector head(nums1, 5) max The maximum value max(nums1) min The minimum value min(nums1) which.max Which element of the vector is the max? which.max(nums1) which.min Which element of the vector is the min? which.min(nums1) mean The average value mean(nums1) median The median median(nums1) var Variance var(nums1) sd Standard deviation sd(nums1) cumsum Cumulative sum (running total) cumsum(nums1) diff Successive difference of a vector diff(nums1) unique Unique values used in the vector unique(nums1) round Rounds numbers to a specified number of decimal points round(nums1, 2) 2.4 Writing code in a script To continue, we are first going to open a script - simply a text file where you can type your code, and execute it immediately. To do so, click on the menu File/New File/R Script. You now have an empty R script, where you can write code, and add comments. A single line can be run by placing the cursor on that line, and clicking ‘Run’ in the menu just to the top-right of the window. Alternatively (and this is recommended), use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl-Enter (or Cmd-Enter on Mac) to run that line. If you make a text selection with the mouse, this selection can be executed with the same keyboard shortcut. 2.5 Vectorized operations In the above section, we introduced a number of functions that you can use to do calculations on a vector of numbers. In R, a number of operations can be done on two vectors, and the result is a vector itself. Basically, R knows to apply these operations one element at a time. This is best illustrated by some examples: # Make two vectors, vec1 &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5) vec2 &lt;- c(11,12,13,14,15) # Add a number, element-wise vec1 + 10 ## [1] 11 12 13 14 15 # Element-wise quadratic: vec1^2 ## [1] 1 4 9 16 25 # Pair-wise multiplication: vec1 * vec2 ## [1] 11 24 39 56 75 # Pair-wise sum: vec1 + vec2 ## [1] 12 14 16 18 20 # Compare the pair-wise sum to the sum of both vectors: sum(vec1) + sum(vec2) ## [1] 80 In each of the above examples, the operators (like + and so on) ‘know’ to make the calculations one element at a time (if one vector), or pair-wise (when two vectors). Clearly, for all examples where two vectors were used, the two vectors need to be the same length (i.e., have the same number of elements). 2.5.1 Applying multiple functions at once In R, we can apply functions and operators in combination. In the following examples, the innermost expressions are always evaluated first. This will make sense after some examples: # Mean of the vector &#39;vec1&#39;, *after* squaring the values: mean(vec1^2) ## [1] 11 # Mean of the vector, *then* square it: mean(vec1)^2 ## [1] 9 # Mean of the log of vec2: mean(log(vec2)) ## [1] 2.558972 # Log of the mean of vec2: log(mean(vec2)) ## [1] 2.564949 Alternatively, we can use the pipe operator, which allows us to write the operators in order of application. For the pipe operator, we need to load the magrittr package (see 2.10 on how to install and load packages). library(magrittr) # Identical to mean(log(vec2)) vec2 %&gt;% log %&gt;% mean ## [1] 2.558972 The above code can be written in at least two other equivalent ways: log(vec2) %&gt;% mean, and even log(vec2) %&gt;% mean(.), where the . indicates explicitly the result from the previous operator. In any of the following, we assume you have loaded either magrittr, or some package that loads it for you (for example, dplyr). If you have not, you will see the error message could not find function \"%&gt;%\". The pipe operator has become very popular, and we use it when it greatly simplifies code, making it easier to follow what the code actually does (and in which order). 2.6 Working with matrices Vectors are one-dimensional collections of data; all elements are of the same type (numeric, character, etc.). A matrix has two dimensions: rows and columns, and again each element (each cell) has the same type. We do not use matrices all that often in R, since a more general data storage type (the dataframe) is generally more useful (there, each column can contain different kind of data). However, sometimes working with matrices is faster, or built-in functions return a matrix - some basic skills are useful. # Construct a matrix with the matrix function: mymat &lt;- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9), ncol=3) # Note how the values are entered in the matrix column-by-column: mymat ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 4 7 ## [2,] 2 5 8 ## [3,] 3 6 9 # Alternatively, add the values row-by-row: mymat2 &lt;- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9), ncol=3, byrow=TRUE) # Note the difference: mymat2 ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 2 3 ## [2,] 4 5 6 ## [3,] 7 8 9 A few built-in functions are especially handy when dealing with a matrix: # Transpose a matrix (flip it alongside the diagonal) t(mymat) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 2 3 ## [2,] 4 5 6 ## [3,] 7 8 9 # Row or column-wise sums rowSums(mymat) ## [1] 12 15 18 # Row or column-wise means colMeans(mymat) ## [1] 2 5 8 # Extract the diagonal: diag(mymat) ## [1] 1 5 9 Functions usually used for vectors often work with matrices, all values are simply treated as if stored in a vector: # Standard deviation sd(mymat) ## [1] 2.738613 # Number of observations length(mymat) ## [1] 9 # Is the same as number of columns * number of rows nrow(mymat) * ncol(mymat) ## [1] 9 As with vectors, we can calculate directly on all elements: mymat * 10 ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 10 40 70 ## [2,] 20 50 80 ## [3,] 30 60 90 2.7 Objects in the workspace In the examples above, we have created a few new objects. These objects are kept in memory for the remainder of your session (that is, until you close R). In RStudio, you can browse all objects that are currently loaded in memory. Objects that are currently loaded in memory make up your workspace. Find the window that has the tab ‘Environment’. Here you see a list of all the objects you have created in this R session. When you click on an object, a window opens that shows the contents of the object. Alternatively, to see which objects you currently have in your workspace, use the following command: ls() ## [1] &quot;nums1&quot; &quot;vec1&quot; &quot;vec2&quot; &quot;words&quot; &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; &quot;a&quot; ## [8] &quot;b&quot; &quot;numbers&quot; To remove objects, rm(nums1, nums2) And to remove all objects that are currently loaded, use this command. you want to use this wisely! rm(list=ls()) Finally, when you are ending your R session, but you want to continue exactly at this point the next time, make sure to save the current workspace. In RStudio, find the menu Session (at the top). Here you can save the current workspace, and also load a previously saved one. 2.8 Files in the working directory Each time you run R, it ‘sees’ one of your folders (‘directories’) and all the files in it. This folder is called the working directory. You can change the working directory in RStudio in a couple of ways. The first option, in Rstudio, is to go to the menu Session &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; Choose Directory.... Or, find the ‘Files’ tab in one of the RStudio windows (usually bottom-right). Here you can browse to the directory you want to use (by clicking on the small ... button on the right ), and click More &gt; Set as working directory. You can also set or query the current working directory by typing the following code: # Set working directory to C:/myR setwd(&quot;C:/myR&quot;) # What is the current working directory? getwd() Note: For Windows users, use a forward slash (that is, /), not a back slash! Finally, you can see which files are available in the current working directory, as well as in subdirectories, using the dir function (Note: a synonym for this function is list.files). # Show files in the working directory: dir() # List files in some other directory: dir(&quot;c:/work/projects/data/&quot;) # Show files in the subdirectory &quot;data&quot;: dir(&quot;data&quot;) # Show files in the working directory that end in csv. # (The ignore.case=TRUE assures that we find files that end in &#39;CSV&#39; as well as &#39;csv&#39;, # and the &#39;[]&#39; is necessary to find the &#39;.&#39; in &#39;.csv&#39;. dir(pattern=&quot;[.]csv&quot;, ignore.case=TRUE) 2.9 Rstudio projects If you end up working primarily from Rstudio, we very strongly recommend the use of Projects in Rstudio to keep your work organized, and to help set the working directory. Rstudio projects are really just small files added to a certain folder, which “tags” that folder as containing a particular project. This idea works best if you have organized your work into smaller subsections, where you keep your different projects in separate folders. 2.10 Packages Throughout this tutorial, we will focus on the basic functionality of R, but we will also call on a number of add-on ‘packages’ that include additional functions. These packages need to be installed (downloaded) before first use, and loaded every time you start a new R session. 2.10.1 Install packages from CRAN You can find a full list of packages available for R on the CRAN site (http://cran.r-project.org/, navigate to ‘Packages’), but be warned – it’s a very long list, with over 10000 packages. If you really want to browse a long list of packages, you should prefer the website http://r-pkg.org/, which provides a nice interface. In RStudio, click on the Packages tab in the lower-right hand panel. There you can see which packages are already installed, and you can install more by clicking on the Install button. Alternatively, to install a particular package, simply type: install.packages(&quot;gplots&quot;) Never use install.packages in an rmarkdown file (it simply does not work), and it is generally bad practice to add it to a script, since you do not want the packages to be installed every time the script is run. Instead, make it clear what the dependencies are in a README file, or use the approach outlined in “Loading many packages” further below, or in “Install missing packages”. The package needs to be installed only once (except when you need to update it, see Section 2.10.6). 2.10.2 Loading packages To use the package in your current R session, type: library(gplots) This loads the gplots package from your local library (where all packages are stored) into working memory. You can now use the functions available in the gplots package. If you close and reopen R, you will need to load the package again (but you don’t have to install it again). To quickly learn which functions are included in a package, type: library(help=gplots) Type .libPaths() to see where your packages are installed. You can change the default directory permanently after setting the environment variable R_LIBS on your system. 2.10.3 Setting the CRAN mirror CRAN is a central package for R packages, but it is hosted on many servers around the world. Back in the day, you always had to set the CRAN ‘mirror’ once for every R session. If you are using Rstudio, though, you won’t have to worry about this as it is set automatically to Rstudio’s own CRAN mirror, which is actually just a clever service that sends you to a nearby server. If you use R from the command line, you might want to set the mirror directly: # Not needed from Rstudio! options(repos = c(CRAN = &quot;https://cran.rstudio.com/&quot;)) This avoids an annoying popup when attempting install.packages. 2.10.4 Install from git hosting sites The previous section applies to packages that have been uploaded to CRAN (the central repository for R packages). It is however also quite common for R packages to be available on Github or Bitbucket - two large web services that host source code under git version control. For repositories that contain R packages, these cannot be installed via install.packages. Instead, do: library(remotes) install_bitbucket(&quot;remkoduursma/fitplc&quot;) This installs an R package from www.bitbucket.org. Similarly, install_github installs the package from www.github.com, if it is hosted there. For this command to work, your system needs to be able to compile R packages from source. Windows users will need to install Rtools. 2.10.5 Updating R and package locations By default, install.packages places the packages in a subdirectory of your R installation, which means that when you update R, you have to reinstall all packages - unless you follow these instructions. To check where your packages are being installed to, type: .libPaths() You may see more than one path listed - packages will be installed to the first directory. It is generally a good idea to make a custom location for all your packages, for example under c:/RLIBRARY, or ~/rpackages, or some other location independent of where R is installed. To do this, you have to add an environment variable R_LIBS, that points to your custom directory. If you don’t know how to do this, simply do a web search for ‘add environment variable windows/mac’. The next time you open Rstudio, .libPaths() should show the custom directory. 2.10.6 Updating packages Besides updating R and Rstudio itself (which is recommended at least every couple of months or so), it is also a very good idea to keep all packages up to date. If your workflow ends up depending on an older version of the package, your code may not work on a different system. To update all installed packages, you can run the following command - make sure to do this right after opening Rstudio: update.packages(ask=FALSE) It is usually best to type ‘no’ when the installation process asks if you want to compile some updated packages. Also, occasionally this process fails - usually stating e.g. ‘package Rcpp not found’. Then first install those packages (the usual way), and retry update.packages. 2.10.7 Install missing packages The reinstallr package can be used to install all packages that are ‘mentioned’ in any of the source files in your working directory. That is, all those that are loaded in an R script, rmarkdown file, and some others, using library or require. You can simply do, library(reinstallr) reinstallr() 2.10.8 Conflicts It is fairly common that certain functions appear in multiple packages. For example, summarize is a function in Hmisc and in dplyr. If you have loaded Hmisc first, and then load dplyr, you will see (among others), the following message: The following objects are masked from ‘package:Hmisc’: src, summarize This means that if you now use summarize(), it will be used from the dplyr package. As a consequence of this, package conflicts are resolved based on the order in which you load the packages. This can be very confusing (and dangerous!). It is better to use the :: operator, when you want to make sure to use a function from a certain package: # Use summarize from dplyr dplyr::summarize(...) In fact, it can be considered very good practice to always use the :: (called a namespace directive) to make it clear in your code where the function is used from. We refrain from using the operator very often in this book though, as it makes the code a bit messy and longer. 2.10.9 Loading many packages If you are using packages in a script file, it is usually considered a good idea to load any packages you will be using at the start of the script. Usually you will see a long list of library(this), and library(that), but we like to use the pacman package at the top of a script, like this: if(!require(pacman))install.packages(&quot;pacman&quot;) pacman::p_load(gplots, geometry, rgl, remotes, svglite) The first line checks whether the pacman package is available (require is like library, except it returns TRUE if the package could be loaded), and if not (!), it is installed. Next, p_load from pacman can be used to load many packages in one line, installing the ones that are not available. This approach is a very concise way to make your script reproducible. 2.11 Accessing the help files Every function that you use in R has its own built-in help file. For example, to access the help file for the arithmetic mean, type ?mean. This opens up the help file in your default browser (but does not require an internet connection). Functions added by loading new packages also have built-in help files. For example, to read about the function bandplot in the gplots package, type: library(gplots) ?bandplot # Alternatively: ?gplots::bandplot Do not get overwhelmed when looking at the help files. Much of R’s reputation for a steep learning curve has to do with the rather obscure and often confusing help files. A good tip for beginners is to not read the help files, but skip straight to the Example section at the bottom of the help file. The first line of the help file, which shows what kind of input, or arguments, the function takes, can also be helpful. The built-in help files offer detailed documentation of built-in functions (and those offered by packages), but often you are looking for something, but don’t quite know what exactly. This frustrating experience is well described by this quote, to R-help in 2006: “This is probably documented, but I cannot find the right words or expression for a search. My attempts failed.” — Denis Chabot Sometimes it is useful to search all help files (including all installed packages, loaded or not) for a keyword, for example ??ANOVA will find everything that mentions ANOVAs. The best advice, though, is simply to just use Google. As a search, simply type the question like you would ask someone else, for example “How to place legend outside plot with ggplot2?”, “(Is there an) R package for 3D plots?”. 2.12 Writing lots of code: rmarkdown or scripts? In this chapter you have written a little code directly to the Console, but for any more serious work you will use scripts or “rmarkdown” documents. In Chapter 5, we will give more information on rmarkdown documents: an outstanding format to collect code, output, and text in a single, well formatted document. Scripts on the other hand only include code (and comments), and can be executed completely, or piece-by-piece by selecting code manually. For both options, a brief summary is provided below. Overall, you want to use scripts if you: Want to be able to run all R code at once, producing some sort of output in files, or some other side-effect (perhaps figures as PDF, new datasets written to disk, objects produced and saved, data downloaded or uploaded, etc.). On the other hand, you should use an rmarkdown document if you: Want to produce a document that includes all output from your analyses, including tables, figures, output from statistical analyses, and so on. The document can be well formatted and directly shared (hiding code, for example), and published on the web or simply emailed to your co-workers. 2.12.1 Reproducible documents with rmarkdown Documents are mix of normal text, with markup (headers, captions, images, tables, formatting), and blocks of code, code chunks. The document can be quickly converted to html, pdf, or an MS Word document, and includes output from code chunks (text output, figures), well formatted. Easy to learn syntax, and Rstudio provides many shortcuts and tools for working with rmarkdown. Output formats include HTML, PDF (if LaTeX is installed) and MS Word. Make not just simple documents, but also HTML presentations (in many formats), blogs (with blogdown), books (with bookdown), auto-generated websites documenting R packages (with pkgdown), and many more templates provided by add-on packages. We give more information in Section 5.4. 2.12.2 Using R scripts Clearly, R markdown is the right solution if you are interested in writing fully reproducable reports or presentations. For everything else, we use R scripts - simply text files that include R code. A script is meant to be fully executable, so that you can run the entire script, producing the desired results, files, objects, or side-effects. In Rstudio, you can open a new R script with File/New File/R script, simply a text file that is saved with extension .R. To run your script, you can either click ‘Source’ on the topright corner of the document, or execute it from R with: source(&quot;myscript.R&quot;) This is not useful when you are interested in the output that you normally see in the console. If you are printing things to the screen in your script, the call to source will not show any of it. You can make these results visible by including print directly in your script, for example: # The output of this will not show up if you # do source(&quot;somescript.R&quot;) summary(mtcars) # Here, the output will be printed to the screen, # also with source() print(summary(cars)) Although the trick with print works, usually you want to switch to rmarkdown if you are interested in viewing the outputs. Scripts are more useful for side effects, for example the creation of new datasets (that are saved to disk), production of figures as PDF files, up- or downloading of files, or even converting an rmarkdown file to HTML with various settings. 2.12.2.1 Running R from the command line From outside R or Rstudio, you can run your script from the command line with Rscript, for example: Rscript myscript.R (Note that this only works on Windows if R is added to the search path). You can also run bits of R code directly via, Rscript -e &quot;sqrt(9)&quot; 2.12.2.2 Running scripts in the background Suppose you have a script that takes a long time to complete. You want to run this script in a background process, so it does not tie up Rstudio for a long time. A nice feature in Rstudio (since late 2018) can be found on the Jobs tab, in the Console pane. There, click ‘Start Job’, and select an R script you would like to run, and the working directory that should be used. The script will be run in the background, and the results will be shown in the Jobs tab. This way you can run an R script for every core you have available to you. 2.13 Exercises 2.13.1 Calculating First inspect Section 2.2 and 2.3 (“Working with vectors”).

Remove the myvec object from your workspace. 2.13.3 Working with a single vector If the last exercise was easy, you can skip this one. 1. The numbers below are the first ten days of rainfall amounts in 1996. Read them into a vector using the c() function. 0.1 0.6 33.8 1.9 9.6 4.3 33.7 0.3 0.0 0.1 Inspect the table with functions in the Section 2.3 (“Working with vectors”), and answer the following questions: 2. Make a vector with the min, max and mean of rainfall. You can also name elements of a vector, for example c(x = 1, y = 2). 3. Calculate the cumulative rainfall (‘running total’) over these ten days. Confirm that the last value of the vector that this produces is equal to the total sum of the rainfall. 4. Which day saw the highest rainfall (write code to get the answer)? 2.13.4 Scripts This exercise will make sure you are able to make a ‘reproducable script’, that is, a script that will allow you to repeat an analysis without having to start over from scratch. First, set up an R script, and save it in your current working directory. 1. Find the History tab in Rstudio. Copy a few lines of history that you would like to keep to the script you just opened, by selecting the line with the mouse and clicking To Source. 2. Tidy up your R script by writing a few comments starting with #. 3. Now make sure your script works completely (that is, it is entirely reproducible). First clear the workspace (rm(list=ls()) or click Clear from the Environment tab). Then, run the entire script (by clicking Source in the script window, top-right). 2.13.5 To quote or not to quote This short exercise points out the use of quotes in R. 1. Run the following code, which makes two numeric objects. one &lt;- 1 two &lt;- 2 2. Run the following two lines of code, and look at the resulting two vectors. The first line makes a character vector, the second line a numeric vector by recalling the objects you just constructed. Make sure you understand the difference. vector1 &lt;- c(&quot;one&quot;,&quot;two&quot;) vector2 &lt;- c(one, two) 3. The following lines of code contain some common errors that prevent them from being evaluated properly or result in error messages. Look at the code without running it and see if you can identify the errors and correct them all. Also execute the faulty code by copying and pasting the text into the console (not typing it, R studio will attempt to avoid these errors by default) so you get to know some common error messages (but not all of these result in errors!). vector1 &lt;- c(&#39;one&#39;, &#39;two&#39;, &#39;three&#39;, &#39;four, &#39;five&#39;, &#39;seven&#39;) vec.var &lt;- var(c(1, 3, 5, 3, 5, 1) vec.mean &lt;- mean(c(1, 3, 5, 3, 5, 1)) vec.Min &lt;- Min(c(1, 3, 5, 3, 5, 1)) Vector2 &lt;- c(&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;f&#39;, &#39;g&#39;) vector2 2.13.6 Working with two vectors First make sure you understand Section 2.5. 1. You have measured five cylinders, their lengths are: 2.1, 3.4, 2.5, 2.7, 2.9 and the diameters are : 0.3, 0.5, 0.6, 0.9, 1.1 Read these data into two vectors (give the vectors appropriate names). 2. Calculate the correlation between lengths and diameters (use the cor function). 3. Calculate the volume of each cylinder (V = length * pi * (diameter / 2)2). 4. Calculate the mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation of the volumes. 5. Assume your measurements are in centimetres. Recalculate the volumes so that their units are in cubic millimetres. Calculate the mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation of these new volumes. 2.13.7 Alphabet aerobics 1 For the second question, you need to know that the 26 letters of the Roman alphabet are conveniently accessible in R via letters and LETTERS. These are not functions, but vectors that are always loaded. 1. Using c() and rep() make this vector (in one line of code): &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;D&quot; &quot;D&quot; &quot;D&quot; and this: &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;D&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;D&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;D&quot; If you are unsure, look at ?rep. 2. Draw 10 random letters from the lowercase alphabet, and sort them alphabetically (Hint: use sample and sort). The solution can be one line of code. 3. Draw 5 random letters from each of the lowercase and uppercase alphabets, incorporating both into a single vector, and sort it alphabetically. 4. Repeat the above exercise but sort the vector alphabetically in descending order. 2.13.8 Comparing and combining vectors This question is harder! You learn three new functions and have to learn by experimenting. Inspect the help page union, and note the useful functions union, setdiff and intersect. These can be used to compare and combine two vectors. Make two vectors : x &lt;- c(1,2,5,9,11) y &lt;- c(2,5,1,0,23) Experiment with the three functions to find solutions to these questions. 1. Find values that are contained in both x and y 2. Find values that are in x but not y (and vice versa). 3. Construct a vector that contains all values contained in either x or y, and compare this vector to c(x,y). 2.13.9 Into the matrix In this exercise you will practice some basic skills with matrices. Recall Section 2.6. 1. Construct a matrix with 10 columns and 10 rows, all filled with random numbers between 0 and 1. 2. Calculate the row means of this matrix (Hint: use rowMeans). Also calculate the standard deviation across the row means (now also use sd). 3. Now remake the above matrix with 100 columns, and 10 rows. Then calculate the column means (using, of course, colMeans), and plot a frequency diagram (a ‘histogram’) using hist. We will see this function in more detail in a later chapter, but it is easy enough to use as you just do hist(myvector), where myvector is any numeric vector (like the column means). What sort of shape of the histogram do you expect? Now repeat the above with more rows, and more columns. 2.13.10 Packages This exercise makes sure you know how to install packages, and load them. First, read the first subsections of 2.10, on installing and loading packages. 1. Install the car package (you only have to do this once for any computer). 2. Load the car package (you have to do this every time you open Rstudio). 3. Look at the help file for densityPlot. 4. Run the example for densityPlot (at the bottom of the help file), by copy-pasting the example into a script, and then executing it. 5. Run the example for densityPlot again, but this time use the example function: example(densityPlot) Follow the instructions to cycle through the different steps. 6. Explore the contents of the car package by clicking first on the Packages tab, then finding the car package, and clicking on that. This way, you can find out about all functions a package contains (which, normally, you hope to avoid, but sometimes it is the only way to find what you are looking for). The same list can be obtained with the command library(help=car), but that displays a list that is not clickable, so probably not as useful. "],

A lot of effort and time is spent on reading, filtering, reshaping, bending and twisting your data before you can actually use the data for visualization and analysis. In this chapter we learn many skills for working with data in R. All of these skills can be seen as mandatory skills before you learn new statistical techniques or fancy new visualizations. We first look at reading datasets into dataframes, filtering data when certain conditions are met, and learn in detail about the most important data types that can be stored in dataframes. We will also look at various ways to summarize data, from simple summaries of what is contained in the original data, to more complex tables of statistics by grouping variables. Finally we will look at merging (joining) dataframes by one or more key-variables, and reshaping datasets (from long to wide, and back). Packages used in this chapter The examples will generally let you know which packages are used, but for your convenience, here is a complete list of the packages used. For plotting, we often use ggplot2 and ggthemes (these are usually omitted from the examples): Otherwise: lgrdata (for the example datasets, see 2.1.1) lubridate (for dates and times) dplyr (for various data skills) padr (for aggregating timeseries data) doBy (for summaryBy, handy for making summary tables) Hmisc (for contents and describe, both summarize dataframes) tidyr (for reshaping dataframes) reshape2 (for reshaping dataframes) data.table (for fread, fast reading of dataframes) readxl (for reading Excel files) stringr (for working with text) 3.2 Generating data 3.2.1 Sequences of numbers Let’s look at a few ways to generate sequences of numbers that we can use in the examples and exercises. There are also a number of real-world situations where you want to use these functions. First, as we saw already, we can use c() to ‘concatenate’ (link together) a series of numbers. We can also combine existing vectors in this way, for example: a &lt;- c(1,2,3) b &lt;- c(4,5,6) c(a,b) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 We can generate sequences of numbers using :, seq and rep, like so: # Sequences of integer numbers using the &quot;:&quot; operator: 1:10 # Numbers 1 through 10 ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 5:-5 # From 5 to -5, backwards ## [1] 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 # Examples using seq() seq(from=10, to=100, by=10) ## [1] 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 seq(from=23, by=2, length=12) ## [1] 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 37 39 41 43 45 # Replicate numbers: rep(2, times = 10) ## [1] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 rep(c(4,5), each=3) ## [1] 4 4 4 5 5 5 The rep function works with any type of vector. For example, character vectors: # Simple replication rep(&quot;a&quot;, times = 3) ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;a&quot; # Repeat elements of a vector rep(c(&quot;E. tereticornis&quot;,&quot;E. saligna&quot;), each=3) ## [1] &quot;E. tereticornis&quot; &quot;E. tereticornis&quot; &quot;E. tereticornis&quot; &quot;E. saligna&quot; ## [5] &quot;E. saligna&quot; &quot;E. saligna&quot; 3.2.2 Random numbers We can draw random numbers using the runif function. The runif function draws from a uniform distribution, meaning there is an equal probability of any number being chosen. # Ten random numbers between 0 and 1 runif(10) ## [1] 0.75318592 0.56689850 0.08143945 0.77908487 0.24182515 0.91305962 ## [7] 0.93866787 0.12658319 0.25581370 0.36059041 # Five random numbers between 100 and 1000 runif(5, 100, 1000) ## [1] 578.5731 483.0499 317.9373 361.0119 885.5366 The runif function is part of a much larger class of functions, each of which returns numbers from a different probability distribution. Inspect the help pages of the functions rnorm for the normal distribution, and rexp for the exponential distribution. Try generating some data from a normal distribution with a mean of 100, and a standard deviation of 10. Next, we will sample numbers from an existing vector. numbers &lt;- 1:15 sample(numbers, size=20, replace=TRUE) ## [1] 5 1 12 11 15 5 9 3 9 8 6 15 2 12 10 8 13 8 2 15 This command samples 20 numbers from the numbers vector, with replacement. 3.3 Reading data There are many ways to read data into R, but we are going to keep things simple and show only a couple of options to read data from text files, and from databases (hosted online). Throughout this book we focus on ‘rectangular data’, that is, data that can be organized in a table with columns and rows. A data table like this, with individual observations in rows, and various data fields in columns, is called a data frame. We first show a few options to read text files into dataframes in R, including comma, tab-delimited, and JSON formats, and how to read data from Excel. Reading data from remote (No)SQL databases is included in Chapter 8. 3.3.1 Reading CSV files A very common text format for data is ‘Comma-Separated Values’, or CSV. You can use read.csv to read these files. Suppose you have the file Allometry.csv in your working directory, you can read in the file into a dataframe with, allometry &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Allometry.csv&quot;) Here, read.csv assumes that your system uses a point (‘.’) to separate digits, but in many parts of the world the default is a comma - in which case values are separated by ‘;’. In this case, use read.csv2 instead of read.csv. Make sure you fully understand the concept of a working directory (see Section 2.8) before continuing. If the file is stored elsewhere, you can specify the entire path (this is known as an absolute path). allometry &lt;- read.csv(&quot;c:/projects/data/Allometry.csv&quot;) It is generally not recommended to use absolute paths, because the script will then depend on an exact location of a datafile. But sometimes you want to refer to very large files or databases that are stored in a central location. If the file is stored in a sub-directory of your working directory, you can specify the relative path. allometry &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/Allometry.csv&quot;) The latter option is probably useful to keep your data files separate from your scripts and outputs in your working directory. The function read.csv has many options, let’s look at some of them. We can skip a number of rows from being read, and only read a fixed number of rows. For example, use this command to read rows 10-15, skipping the header line (which is in the first line of the file) and the next 9 lines. you have to skip 10 rows to read rows 10-15, because the header line (which is ignored) counts as a row in the text file! allomsmall &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Allometry.csv&quot;, skip=10, nrows=5, header=FALSE) 3.3.2 Reading large CSV files We used the built-in read.csv function above, but note that for large files, it is rather slow. The best alternative is to use fread from the data.table package. The data.table package is an excellent resource if you need to do data manipulations on large files (though the syntax takes some getting used to). library(data.table) allom &lt;- fread(&quot;Allometry.csv&quot;) Of course, you could use fread even for small files, but I generally recommend to keep dependencies to a minimum. In other words, use built-in (‘base’) functions when you can, to develop more robust and reproducable code. 3.3.3 Reading Tab-delimited text files Sometimes, data files are provided as text files that are TAB-delimited. To read these files, use the following command: mydata &lt;- read.table(&quot;sometabdelimdata.txt&quot;, header=TRUE) In fact, read.table is the more general function - read.csv is a specific case for comma-delimited files. When using read.table, you must specify whether a header (i.e., a row with column names) is present in the dataset (unlike read.csv, it is the default to not read the header). If you have a text file with some other delimiter, for example ;, use the sep argument: mydata &lt;- read.table(&quot;somedelimdata.txt&quot;, header=TRUE, sep=&quot;;&quot;) 3.3.4 Including data in a script You can also write the dataset in a text file, and read it as in the following examples. This is useful if you have (found) a small dataset that you typed in by hand, or for making reproducible code snippets that include the dataset. read.table(header=TRUE, text=&quot; a b 1 2 3 4 &quot;) ## a b ## 1 1 2 ## 2 3 4 3.3.5 JSON A very popular format for data, especially on the web, is JSON - a text-based format that can represent not just rectangular data (dataframes), but any complex nested data structure. We can use the jsonlite package to read JSON data, and convert it to a dataframe if the data allows it, as in the following example. # Fake data can be read fro this site. # Visit the link to see what the original data looks like. url &lt;- &quot;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1/comments&quot; # Package to read JSON; it is very fast. library(jsonlite) # fromJSON reads and simplifies the data into a dataframe (if possible) comment_data &lt;- fromJSON(url) # We end up with a dataframe. Hmisc::contents(comment_data) ## ## Data frame:comment_data 500 observations and 5 variables Maximum # NAs:0 ## ## ## Storage ## postId integer ## id integer ## name character ## email character ## body character 3.3.6 (No)SQL databases We show examples of how to obtain data from SQL and NoSQL databases in Chapter 8. 3.3.7 Excel spreadsheets Excel spreadsheets are not a recommended way to store data, but often you don’t make that choice yourself. If you do need to read an XLS or XLSX file, the readxl package works very well. Note: avoid older implementations like the xlsx package and read.xls in the gtools package, which are less reliable. library(readxl) mydata &lt;- read_excel(&quot;mspreadsheet.xlsx&quot;, sheet = 2) Here, sheet will specify the sheet by number, alternatively you can refer to the sheet by name (e.g., sheet = 'rawdata'). 3.3.8 Proprietary formats Many statistical software packages store data in their own format, not just text files. For data from SPSS, SAS or Stata, we recommend the haven package for reading the data into dataframes, and the foreign package provides further support for Minitab, Systat, and Weka. 3.3.9 Web services Nowadays many data are available via a ‘RESTful’ API, which is now by far the most common way to download publicly available (open) data (and many other services as well). We discuss reading data from a REST service, as well as setting up our REST service in Chapter 8. 3.4 Working with dataframes As mentioned, this book focuses heavily on dataframes, because this is the object you will use most of the time in data analysis. The following sections provide a brief introduction, but we will see many examples using dataframes throughout this manual. Like matrices, dataframes have two dimensions: they contain both columns and rows. Unlike matrices, each column can hold a different type of data. This is very useful for keeping track of different types of information about data points. For example, you might use one column to hold height measurements, and another to hold the matching species IDs. When you read in a file using read.csv, the data is automatically stored in a dataframe. Dataframes can also be created from scratch using the function data.frame (see Section 3.4.1), but usually we start with data read from a file. What is a tibble? Sometimes you will notice that some functions return objects that are very similar to dataframes, but are actually called ‘tibbles’ (for example, read_excel returns one). A tibble is a newer format for dataframes, and is internally very nearly the same. You can pretty much always assume that dataframes and tibbles behave in the same way. 3.4.1 Convert vectors into a dataframe Suppose you have two or more vectors (of the same length), and you want to include these in a new dataframe. You can use the function data.frame. Here is a simple example: vec1 &lt;- c(9,10,1,2,45) vec2 &lt;- 1:5 data.frame(x = vec1, y = vec2) ## x y ## 1 9 1 ## 2 10 2 ## 3 1 3 ## 4 2 4 ## 5 45 5 Here, we made a dataframe with columns named x and y. Note: take care to ensure that the vectors have the same length, otherwise it won’t work! Modify the previous example so that the two vectors are not the same length. Then, attempt to combine them in a dataframe and inspect the resulting error message. 3.4.2 Variables in the dataframe We read the allometry data (make sure the lgrdata package is loaded) to practice basic dataframe skills. library(lgrdata) data(allometry) After reading the dataframe, it is good practice to always quickly inspect the dataframe to see if anything went wrong. I routinely look at the first few rows with head. Then, to check the types of variables in the dataframe, use the str function (short for ‘structure’). This function is useful for other objects as well, to view in detail what the object contains. head(allometry) ## species diameter height leafarea branchmass ## 1 PSME 54.61 27.04 338.485622 410.24638 ## 2 PSME 34.80 27.42 122.157864 83.65030 ## 3 PSME 24.89 21.23 3.958274 3.51270 ## 4 PSME 28.70 24.96 86.350653 73.13027 ## 5 PSME 34.80 29.99 63.350906 62.39044 ## 6 PSME 37.85 28.07 61.372765 53.86594 str(allometry) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 63 obs. of 5 variables: ## $ species : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;PIMO&quot;,&quot;PIPO&quot;,..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ... ## $ diameter : num 54.6 34.8 24.9 28.7 34.8 ... ## $ height : num 27 27.4 21.2 25 30 ... ## $ leafarea : num 338.49 122.16 3.96 86.35 63.35 ... ## $ branchmass: num 410.25 83.65 3.51 73.13 62.39 ... Individual variables in a dataframe can be extracted using the dollar $ sign. Let’s print all the tree diameters here, after rounding to one decimal point: round(allometry$diameter,1) ## [1] 54.6 34.8 24.9 28.7 34.8 37.9 22.6 39.4 39.9 26.2 43.7 69.8 44.5 56.6 ## [15] 54.6 5.3 6.1 7.4 8.3 13.5 51.3 22.4 69.6 58.4 33.3 44.2 30.5 27.4 ## [29] 43.2 38.9 52.6 20.8 24.1 24.9 46.0 35.0 23.9 60.2 12.4 4.8 70.6 11.4 ## [43] 11.9 60.2 60.7 70.6 57.7 43.1 18.3 43.4 18.5 12.9 37.9 26.9 38.6 6.5 ## [57] 31.8 73.7 28.2 61.5 51.6 18.3 8.4 It is also straightforward to add new variables to a dataframe. Let’s convert the tree diameter to inches, and add it to the dataframe as a new variable: allometry$diameterInch &lt;- allometry$diameter / 2.54 Instead of using the $-notation every time (which can result in lengthy, messy code, especially when your variable names are long) you can use with to indicate where the variables are stored. Let’s add a new variable called volindex, a volume index defined as the square of tree diameter times height: allometry$volindex &lt;- with(allometry, diameter^2 * height) The with function allows for more readable code, while at the same time making sure that the variables diameter and height are read from the dataframe allometry. An even better approach is to use mutate from the dplyr package (similar to base R’s transform, but with a useful advantage). library(dplyr) allometry &lt;- mutate(allometry, diameterInch = diameter / 2.54, volindex = diameterInch^2 * height) Where mutate adds new variables to the dataframe, and (unlike transform) it is able to use variables used just before in the same call (note diameterInch was created in the same call). The above examples are important - many times throughout this book you will be required to perform similar operations. As an exercise, also add the ratio of height to diameter to the dataframe. A simple summary of the dataframe can be printed with the summary function; where we use indexing ([,1:3]) to use the first three columns of allometry only to save space. summary(allometry[,1:3]) ## species diameter height ## PIMO:19 Min. : 4.83 Min. : 3.57 ## PIPO:22 1st Qu.:21.59 1st Qu.:21.26 ## PSME:22 Median :34.80 Median :28.40 ## Mean :35.56 Mean :26.01 ## 3rd Qu.:51.44 3rd Qu.:33.93 ## Max. :73.66 Max. :44.99 For the numeric variables, the minimum, 1st quantile, median, mean, 3rd quantile, and maximum values are printed. For so-called ‘factor’ variables (i.e., categorical variables), a simple table is printed (in this case, for the species variable). We will come back to factors in Section sec:workingfactors. If the variables have missing values, the number of missing values is printed as well (see Section 3.7.3). To see how many rows and columns your dataframe contains (handy for double-checking you read the data correctly), use nrow and ncol. Alternatively, dim gives the ‘dimension’ of the dataframe (rows x columns). nrow(allometry) ## [1] 63 ncol(allometry) ## [1] 7 3.4.3 Changing column names in dataframes To access the names of a dataframe as a vector, use the names function. You can also use this to change the names. Consider this example: # read names: names(allometry) ## [1] &quot;species&quot; &quot;diameter&quot; &quot;height&quot; &quot;leafarea&quot; ## [5] &quot;branchmass&quot; &quot;diameterInch&quot; &quot;volindex&quot; # rename all (make sure vector is same length as number of columns!) names(allometry) &lt;- c(&quot;spec&quot;,&quot;diam&quot;,&quot;ht&quot;,&quot;leafarea&quot;,&quot;branchm&quot;) We can also change some of the names, using simple indexing (see Section 3.5.1). # rename Second one to &#39;Diam&#39; names(allometry)[2] &lt;- &quot;Diam&quot; # rename 1st and 2nd: names(allometry)[1:2] &lt;- c(&quot;SP&quot;,&quot;D&quot;) Better yet is to use rename from the dplyr package, which makes sure you change the right column names (indexing as above can be dangerous if the order of columns has changed!). library(dplyr) # The names on the right are the original names, on the left are the new ones. allometry &lt;- rename(allometry, spec = species, diam = diameter) 3.5 Extracting data 3.5.1 Vectors Let’s look at reordering or taking subsets of a vector, or indexing as it is commonly called. This is an important skill to learn, so we will look at several examples. Let’s define two numeric vectors: nums1 &lt;- c(1,4,2,8,11,100,8) nums2 &lt;- c(3.3,8.1,2.5,9.8,21.2,13.8,0.9) Individual elements of a vector can be extracted using square brackets, [ ]. For example, to extract the first and then the fifth element of a vector: nums1[1] ## [1] 1 nums1[5] ## [1] 11 You can also use another object to do the indexing, as long as it contains a integer number. For example, # Get last element: nelements &lt;- length(nums1) nums1[nelements] ## [1] 8 This last example extracts the last element of a vector. To do this, we first found the length of the vector, and used that to index the vector to extract the last element. We can also select multiple elements, by indexing the vector with another vector. Recall how to construct sequences of numbers, explained in Section 3.2.1. # Select the first 3: nums1[1:3] ## [1] 1 4 2 # Select a few elements of a vector: selectthese &lt;- c(1,5,2) nums1[selectthese] ## [1] 1 11 4 # Select every other element: everyother &lt;- seq(1,7,by=2) nums1[everyother] ## [1] 1 2 11 8 # Select five random elements: ranels &lt;- sample(1:length(nums2), 5) nums2[ranels] ## [1] 3.3 13.8 21.2 8.1 0.9 # Remove the first element: nums1[-1] ## [1] 4 2 8 11 100 8 # Remove the first and last element: nums1[-c(1, length(nums1))] ## [1] 4 2 8 11 100 Next, we can look at selecting elements of a vector based on the values in that vector. Suppose we want to make a new vector, based on vector nums2 but only where the value within certain bounds. We can use simple logical statements to index a vector. # Subset of nums2, where value is at least 10 : nums2[nums2 &gt; 10] ## [1] 21.2 13.8 # Subset of nums2, where value is between 5 and 10: nums2[nums2 &gt; 5 &amp; nums2 &lt; 10] ## [1] 8.1 9.8 # Subset of nums2, where value is smaller than 1, or larger than 20: nums2[nums2 &lt; 1 | nums2 &gt; 20] ## [1] 21.2 0.9 # Subset of nums1, where value is exactly 8: nums1[nums1 == 8] ## [1] 8 8 # Subset nums1 where number is NOT equal to 100 nums1[nums1 != 100] ## [1] 1 4 2 8 11 8 # Subset of nums1, where value is one of 1,4 or 11: nums1[nums1 %in% c(1,4,11)] ## [1] 1 4 11 # Subset of nums1, where value is NOT 1,4 or 11: nums1[!(nums1 %in% c(1,4,11))] ## [1] 2 8 100 8 These examples showed you several new logical operators (&lt;, &gt;, ==, &amp;). See the help page ?Logic for more details on logical operators. We will return to logical data in Section sec:workinglogic. 3.5.1.1 Assigning new values to subsets All of this becomes very useful if we realize that new values can be easily assigned to subsets. This works for any of the examples above. For instance, # Where nums1 was 100, make it -100 nums1[nums1 == 100] &lt;- -100 # Where nums2 was less than 5, make it zero nums2[nums2 &lt; 5] &lt;- 0 Using the first set of examples in this section, practice assigning new values to subsets of vectors. 3.5.2 Dataframes In base R, there are two ways to take a subset of a dataframe: using the square bracket notation ([]) as in the above examples, or using the filter function from the dplyr package. We will learn both, as they are both useful from time to time. Similar to vectors, dataframes can be indexed with row and column numbers using mydataframe[row,column]. Here, row refers to the row number (which can be a vector of any length), and column to the column number (which can also be a vector). You can also refer to the column by its name rather than its number, which can be very useful. All this will become clearer after some examples. Let’s look at a few examples using the Allometry dataset. # Load data data(allometry) # Extract tree diameters: take the 4th observation of the 2nd variable: allometry[4,2] ## [1] 28.7 # We can also index the dataframe by its variable name: allometry[4,&quot;diameter&quot;] ## [1] 28.7 # Extract the first 3 rows of &#39;height&#39;: allometry[1:3, &quot;height&quot;] ## [1] 27.04 27.42 21.23 # Extract the first 5 rows, of ALL variables # Note the use of the comma followed by nothing # This means &#39;every column&#39; and is very useful! allometry[1:5,] ## species diameter height leafarea branchmass ## 1 PSME 54.61 27.04 338.485622 410.24638 ## 2 PSME 34.80 27.42 122.157864 83.65030 ## 3 PSME 24.89 21.23 3.958274 3.51270 ## 4 PSME 28.70 24.96 86.350653 73.13027 ## 5 PSME 34.80 29.99 63.350906 62.39044 # Extract the fourth column # Here we use nothing, followed by a comma, # to indicate &#39;every row&#39; allometry[,4] ## [1] 338.485622 122.157864 3.958274 86.350653 63.350906 61.372765 ## [7] 32.077794 147.270523 141.787332 45.020041 145.809802 349.057010 ## [13] 176.029213 319.507115 234.368784 4.851567 7.595163 11.502851 ## [19] 25.380647 65.698749 160.839174 31.780702 189.733007 253.308265 ## [25] 91.538428 90.453658 99.736790 34.464685 68.150309 46.326060 ## [31] 160.993131 9.806496 20.743280 21.649603 66.633675 54.267994 ## [37] 19.844680 131.727303 22.365837 2.636336 411.160376 15.476022 ## [43] 14.493428 169.053644 139.651156 376.308256 417.209436 103.672633 ## [49] 33.713580 116.154916 44.934469 18.855867 154.078625 70.602797 ## [55] 169.163842 7.650902 93.072006 277.494360 131.856837 121.428976 ## [61] 212.443589 82.093031 6.551044 # Select only &#39;height&#39; and &#39;diameter&#39;, store in new dataframe: allomhd &lt;- allometry[,c(&quot;height&quot;, &quot;diameter&quot;)] As we saw when working with vectors (see Section 3.5.1), we can use expressions to extract data.

Try this on some of the examples above. 3.5.3 A faster method While the above method to index dataframes is very flexible and concise, sometimes it leads to code that is difficult to understand. It is also easy to make mistakes when you subset dataframes by the column or row number (imagine the situation where the dataset has changed and you redo the analysis). Consider the filter function as a convenient and safe alternative, from the dplyr package. (Note that base R provides a nearly identical function, subset, but filter is much faster). With filter, you can select rows that meet a certain criterion, and columns as well. This example uses the pupae data. The last example shows the use of select from dplyr to keep only certain columns, conveniently with the pipe operator. # Read data data(pupae) # For filter(), select(). library(dplyr) # Take subset of pupae, ambient temperature treatment and CO2 is 280. # Note: statements separated by commas are interpreted as AND by filter() filter(pupae, T_treatment == &quot;ambient&quot;, CO2_treatment == 280, Gender == 0) ## T_treatment CO2_treatment Gender PupalWeight Frass ## 1 ambient 280 0 0.244 1.900 ## 2 ambient 280 0 0.221 NA ## 3 ambient 280 0 0.280 1.996 ## 4 ambient 280 0 0.257 1.069 ## 5 ambient 280 0 0.275 2.198 ## 6 ambient 280 0 0.254 2.220 ## 7 ambient 280 0 0.258 1.877 ## 8 ambient 280 0 0.224 1.488 # (not all output shown) # Take subset where Frass is larger than 2.9. # Also, keep only variables &#39;PupalWeight&#39; and &#39;Frass&#39;. filter(pupae, Frass &gt; 2.6) %&gt;% select(PupalWeight, Frass) ## PupalWeight Frass ## 1 0.319 2.770 ## 2 0.384 2.672 ## 3 0.385 2.603 ## 4 0.405 3.117 ## 5 0.473 2.631 ## 6 0.469 2.747 3.5.4 Deleting columns It is rarely necessary to delete columns from a dataframe, unless you want to save a copy of the dataframe to disk (see Section 3.6). Instead of deleting columns, you can take a subset and make a new dataframe to continue with. Also, it should not be necessary to delete columns from the dataframe that you have accidentally created in a reproducible script: when things go wrong, simply clear the workspace and run the entire script again. That aside, you have the following options to delete a column from a dataframe. # A simple example dataframe dfr &lt;- data.frame(a=-5:0, b=10:15) # Delete the second column (make a new dataframe &#39;dfr2&#39; that does not include that column) # This only works if you know the column index (here, 2) for sure, # it does not work with a column name! dfr2 &lt;- dfr[,-2] # Using select() from the dplyr, we can drop columns by name: dfr2 &lt;- select(dfr, -a) 3.6 Exporting data To write a dataframe to a comma-separated values (CSV) file, use the write.csv function. For example, # Some data dfr &lt;- data.frame(x=1:3, y=2:4) # Write to disk (row names are generally not wanted in the CSV file). write.csv(dfr,&quot;somedata.csv&quot;, row.names=FALSE) If you want more options, or a different delimiter (such as TAB), look at the write.table function. Note that if you write a dataset to a text file, and read it back in with read.csv (or read.table), the dataset will not be exactly the same. One reason is the number of digits used in the text file, or that you have converted some columns to character, numeric, or whatever. If you want to store a dataframe to disk, and later read it back into R exactly as it was before, it is preferred to use a binary format. This idea works for any R object, not just dataframes: # Much faster than writing text files, resulting files are much smaller, # and objects are saved exactly as they were in R. saveRDS(dfr, &quot;somefile.rds&quot;) # To read the object back in, do: dfr &lt;- readRDS(&quot;somefile.rds&quot;) It is also possible to save all objects that are currently loaded in memory (everything that shows up with ls()) with the command save.image. However, we strongly urge against it, as it is easy to lose track of which objects are important, and it is too easy to make a mess of things. A fresh installation of Rstudio saves all your objects after you quit Rstudio, but as we mentioned in Section 2.1, we suggest you switch that behaviour off. 3.7 Special data types Now that we know how to read in dataframes, it is time we take a closer look at the types of data that can be contained in a dataframe. For the purpose of this book, a dataframe can contain six types of data. These are summarized in the table below: Data type Description Example Section numeric Any number, including double (double precision floating point) and integer (whole numbers). In R you very rarely have to worry about the exact nature of numeric values. c(1, 12.3491, 10/2, 10^6, pi) character Strings of text c('apple', 'pear', letters[1:3]) 3.7.4 factor Categorial variable. Preferred over character when few unique levels (values) present in the data. Must use in statistical models, plotting. Internally stored as an integer corresponding to the level of the factor variable. factor(c('Control','Fertilized','Irrigated')) 3.7.1 logical Either TRUE or FALSE. Internally stored as 0 (FALSE) or 1 (TRUE). 10 == 100/10 3.7.2 Date Special Date class. Internally stored as number of days since 1970-1-1. as.Date(Sys.time()) 3.7.5.1 POSIXct Special Date-time class. Internally stored as number of seconds since 1970-1-1, and may have timezone attributes. lubridate::ymd_hms('1883-08-26 14:00') 3.7.5.3 Also, R has a very useful built-in data type to represent missing values. This is represented by NA (Not Available) (see Section 3.7.3). We will show how to convert between data types at the end of this chapter (Section 3.7.6). 3.7.1 Working with factors The factor data type is used to represent qualitative, categorical data. When reading data from file, for example with read.csv, R will automatically convert any variable to a factor if it is unable to convert it to a numeric variable. If a variable is actually numeric, but you want to treat it as a factor, you can use as.factor to convert it, as in the following example. # Make sure you have loaded the lgrdata package data(pupae) # This dataset contains a temperature (T_treatment) and CO2 treatment (CO2_treatment). # Both should logically be factors, however, CO2_treatment is read as numeric: str(pupae) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 84 obs. of 5 variables: ## $ T_treatment : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;ambient&quot;,&quot;elevated&quot;: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ CO2_treatment: int 280 280 280 280 280 280 280 280 280 280 ... ## $ Gender : int 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 ... ## $ PupalWeight : num 0.244 0.319 0.221 0.28 0.257 0.333 0.275 0.312 0.254 0.356 ... ## $ Frass : num 1.9 2.77 NA 2 1.07 ... # To convert it to a factor, we use: pupae$CO2_treatment &lt;- as.factor(pupae$CO2_treatment) # Compare with the above, str(pupae) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 84 obs. of 5 variables: ## $ T_treatment : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;ambient&quot;,&quot;elevated&quot;: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ CO2_treatment: Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;280&quot;,&quot;400&quot;: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ Gender : int 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 ... ## $ PupalWeight : num 0.244 0.319 0.221 0.28 0.257 0.333 0.275 0.312 0.254 0.356 ... ## $ Frass : num 1.9 2.77 NA 2 1.07 ... In the allometry example dataset, the species variable is a good example of a factor. A factor variable has a number of ‘levels’, which are the text values that the variable has in the dataset. Factors can also represent treatments of an experimental study. For example, data(allometry) levels(allometry$species) ## [1] &quot;PIMO&quot; &quot;PIPO&quot; &quot;PSME&quot; Shows the three species in this dataset. We can also count the number of rows in the dataframe for each species, like this: table(allometry$species) ## ## PIMO PIPO PSME ## 19 22 22 Note that the three species are always shown in the order of the levels of the factor: when the dataframe was read, these levels were assigned based on alphabetical order. Often, this is not a very logical order, and you may want to rearrange the levels to get more meaningful results. In our example, let’s shuffle the levels around, using factor. allometry$species &lt;- factor(allometry$species, levels=c(&quot;PSME&quot;,&quot;PIMO&quot;,&quot;PIPO&quot;)) Now revisit the commands above, and note that the results are the same, but the order of the levels of the factor is different. You can also reorder the levels of a factor by the values of another variable, see the example in Section 4.1.4. 3.7.1.1 Turn numeric data into factors We can also generate new factors, and add them to the dataframe. This is a common application: # Add a new variable to allom: &#39;small&#39; when diameter is less than 10, &#39;large&#39; otherwise. allometry$treeSizeClass &lt;- factor(ifelse(allometry$diameter &lt; 10, &quot;small&quot;, &quot;large&quot;)) # Now, look how many trees fall in each class. # Note that somewhat confusingly, &#39;large&#39; is printed before &#39;small&#39;. # Once again, this is because the order of the factor levels is alphabetical by default. table(allometry$treeSizeClass) ## ## large small ## 56 7 What if we want to add a new factor based on a numeric variable with more than two levels? In that case, we cannot use ifelse. We must find a different method. Look at this example using cut. # The cut function takes a numeric vectors and cuts it into a categorical variable. # Continuing the example above, let&#39;s make &#39;small&#39;,&#39;medium&#39; and &#39;large&#39; tree size classes: allometry$treeSizeClass &lt;- cut(allometry$diameter, breaks=c(0,25,50,75), labels=c(&quot;small&quot;,&quot;medium&quot;,&quot;large&quot;)) # And the results, table(allometry$treeSizeClass) ## ## small medium large ## 22 24 17 3.7.1.2 Empty factor levels It is important to understand how factors are used in R: they are not simply text variables, or ‘character strings’. Each unique value of a factor variable is assigned a level, which is used every time you summarize your data by the factor variable. Crucially, even when you delete data, the original factor level is still present. Although this behaviour might seem strange, it makes a lot of sense in many cases (zero observations for a particular factor level can be quite informative!). Sometimes it is more convenient to drop empty factor levels with the droplevels function. Consider this example: # Note that &#39;T_treatment&#39; (temperature treatment) is a factor with two levels, # with 37 and 47 observations in total: table(pupae$T_treatment) ## ## ambient elevated ## 37 47 # Suppose we decide to keep only the ambient treatment: pupae_amb &lt;- dplyr::filter(pupae, T_treatment == &quot;ambient&quot;) # Now, the level is still present, although empty: table(pupae_amb$T_treatment) ## ## ambient elevated ## 37 0 # In this case, we don&#39;t want to keep the empty factor level. # Use droplevels to get rid of any empty levels: pupae_amb2 &lt;- droplevels(pupae_amb) Compare the summary of pupae_amb and pupae_amb2, and note the differences. 3.7.1.3 Changing the levels of a factor Sometimes you may want to change the levels of a factor, for example to replace abbreviations with more readable labels. To do this, we can assign new values with the levels function, as in the following example using the pupae data: # Change the levels of T_treatment by assigning a character vector to the levels. levels(pupae$T_treatment) &lt;- c(&quot;Ambient&quot;,&quot;Ambient + 3C&quot;) # Or only change the first level, using subscripting. levels(pupae$T_treatment)[1] &lt;- &quot;Control&quot; Using the method above, you can also merge levels of a factor, simply by assigning the same new level to both old levels. Try this on a dataset of your choice (for example, in the allom data, you can assign new species levels, ‘Douglas-fir’ for PSME, and ‘Pine’ for both PIMO and PIPO). Then check the results with levels(). 3.7.2 Working with logical data Some data can only take two values: true, or false. For data like these, R has the logical data type. The following examples use various logical operators, and all return TRUE or FALSE, or a vector of them. The help page ?Syntax has a comprehensive list of operators in R (including the logical operators). # Answers to (in)equalities are always logical: 10 &gt; 5 ## [1] TRUE 101 == 100 + 1 ## [1] TRUE # ... or use objects for comparison: apple &lt;- 2 pear &lt;- 3 apple == pear ## [1] FALSE # NOT equal to. apple != pear ## [1] TRUE # Logical comparisons like these also work for vectors, for example: nums &lt;- c(10,21,5,6,0,1,12) nums &gt; 5 ## [1] TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE The functions which, any and all are very useful to know when working with logical data: # Find which of the numbers are larger than 5: which(nums &gt; 5) ## [1] 1 2 4 7 # Other useful functions are &#39;any&#39; and &#39;all&#39;: # Are any numbers larger than 25? any(nums &gt; 25) ## [1] FALSE # Are all numbers less than or equal to 10? all(nums &lt;= 10) ## [1] FALSE You have already been using logical data when we filtered dataframes and vectors: # Use &amp; for AND, for example to take subsets where two conditions are met: subset(pupae, PupalWeight &gt; 0.4 &amp; Frass &gt; 3) ## T_treatment CO2_treatment Gender PupalWeight Frass ## 25 ambient 400 1 0.405 3.117 # Use | for OR nums[nums &lt; 2 | nums &gt; 20] ## [1] 21 0 1 Logical data are coded by integer numbers (0 = FALSE, 1 = TRUE), but normally you don’t see this, since R will only print TRUE and FALSE ‘labels’. However, once you know this, some analyses become even easier. # How many numbers are larger than 5? #- Short solution sum(nums &gt; 5) ## [1] 4 #- Long solution length(nums[nums &gt; 5]) ## [1] 4 # What fraction of data is larger than some value? mean(pupae$PupalWeight &gt; 0.3) ## [1] 0.4880952 3.7.3 Working with missing values In R, missing values are represented with NA, a special data type that indicates the data is simply Not Available. Many functions can handle missing data, usually in different ways. For example, suppose we have the following vector: myvec1 &lt;- c(11,13,5,6,NA,9) In order to calculate the mean, we might want to either exclude the missing value (and calculate the mean of the remaining five numbers), or we might want mean(myvec1) to fail (produce an error). This last case is useful if we don’t expect missing values, and want R to only calculate the mean when there are no NA’s in the dataset. These two options are shown in this example: # Calculate mean: this fails if there are missing values mean(myvec1) ## [1] NA # Calculate mean after removing the missing values mean(myvec1, na.rm=TRUE) ## [1] 8.8 Many functions have an argument na.rm, or similar. Refer to the help page of the function to learn about the various options (if any) for dealing with missing values. For example, see the help pages ?lm and ?sd. The function is.na returns TRUE when a value is missing, which can be useful to see which values are missing, or how many, # Is a value missing? (TRUE or FALSE) is.na(myvec1) ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE # Which of the elements of a vector is missing? which(is.na(myvec1)) ## [1] 5 # How many values in a vector are NA? sum(is.na(myvec1)) ## [1] 1 3.7.3.1 Making missing values In many cases it is useful to change some bad data values to NA. We can use our indexing skills to do so, # Some vector that contains bad values coded as -9999 datavec &lt;- c(2,-9999,100,3,-9999,5) # Assign NA to the values that were -9999 datavec[datavec == -9999] &lt;- NA In other cases, missing values arise when certain operations did not produce the desired result. Consider this example, # A character vector, some of these look like numbers: myvec &lt;- c(&quot;101&quot;,&quot;289&quot;,&quot;12.3&quot;,&quot;abc&quot;,&quot;99&quot;) # Convert the vector to numeric: as.numeric(myvec) ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion ## [1] 101.0 289.0 12.3 NA 99.0 The warning message NAs introduced by coercion means that missing values were produced by when we tried to turn one data type (character) to another (numeric). 3.7.3.2 Not A Number Another type of missing value is the result of calculations that went wrong, for example: # Attempt to take the logarithm of a negative number: log(-1) ## Warning in log(-1): NaNs produced ## [1] NaN The result is NaN, short for Not A Number. Dividing by zero is not usually meaningful, but R does not produce a missing value: 1000/0 ## [1] Inf It produces ‘Infinity’ instead. 3.7.3.3 Missing values in dataframes When working with dataframes, you often want to remove missing values for a particular analysis. We’ll use the pupae dataset for the following examples. Note we use the dplyr package for filter. # (re-)load data data(pupae) # Look at a summary to see if there are missing values: summary(pupae) ## T_treatment CO2_treatment Gender PupalWeight ## ambient :37 Min. :280.0 Min. :0.0000 Min. :0.1720 ## elevated:47 1st Qu.:280.0 1st Qu.:0.0000 1st Qu.:0.2562 ## Median :400.0 Median :0.0000 Median :0.2975 ## Mean :344.3 Mean :0.4487 Mean :0.3110 ## 3rd Qu.:400.0 3rd Qu.:1.0000 3rd Qu.:0.3560 ## Max. :400.0 Max. :1.0000 Max. :0.4730 ## NA&#39;s :6 ## Frass ## Min. :0.986 ## 1st Qu.:1.515 ## Median :1.818 ## Mean :1.846 ## 3rd Qu.:2.095 ## Max. :3.117 ## NA&#39;s :1 # Notice there are 6 NA&#39;s (missing values) for Gender, and 1 for Frass. # Option 1: take subset of data where Gender is not missing: pupae_subs1 &lt;- filter(pupae, !is.na(Gender)) # Option 2: take subset of data where Frass AND Gender are not missing pupae_subs2 &lt;- filter(pupae, !is.na(Frass), !is.na(Gender)) # A more rigorous subset: remove all rows from a dataset where ANY variable # has a missing value: pupae_nona &lt;- pupae[complete.cases(pupae),] # This was an example where indexing (using square brackets) is a bit more # convenient than the dplyr approach, where we have to write the following. # A number of similar looking statements do not work! pupae_nona &lt;- pupae %&gt;% filter(complete.cases(.)) 3.7.3.4 Subsetting when there are missing values When there are missing values in a vector, and you take a subset (for example all data larger than some value), should the missing values be included or dropped? There is no one answer to this, but it is important to know that subset drops them, but the square bracket method ([]) keeps them. Consider this example, and especially the use of which to drop missing values when subsetting. # A small dataframe dfr &lt;- data.frame(a=1:4, b=c(4,NA,6,NA)) # subset drops all missing values # Note: dplyr::filter also drops NA subset(dfr, b &gt; 4, select=b) ## b ## 3 6 # square bracket notation keeps them dfr[dfr$b &gt; 4,&quot;b&quot;] ## [1] NA 6 NA # ... but drops them when we use &#39;which&#39; dfr[which(dfr$b &gt; 4),&quot;b&quot;] ## [1] 6 3.7.4 Working with text Many datasets include variables that are text only (think of comments, species names, locations, sample codes, and so on), it is useful to learn how to modify, extract, and analyse text-based (‘character’) variables. Consider the following simple examples when working with a single character string: # Count number of characters in a bit of text: sentence &lt;- &quot;Not a very long sentence.&quot; nchar(sentence) ## [1] 25 # Extract the first 3 characters: substr(sentence, 1, 3) ## [1] &quot;Not&quot; We can also apply these functions to a vector: # Substring all elements of a vector substr(c(&quot;good&quot;,&quot;good riddance&quot;,&quot;good on ya&quot;),1,4) ## [1] &quot;good&quot; &quot;good&quot; &quot;good&quot; # Number of characters of all elements of a vector nchar(c(&quot;hey&quot;,&quot;hi&quot;,&quot;how&quot;,&quot;ya&quot;,&quot;doin&quot;)) ## [1] 3 2 3 2 4 3.7.4.1 Combining text To glue bits of text together, use the paste function, like so: # Add a suffix to each text element of a vector: txt &lt;- c(&quot;apple&quot;,&quot;pear&quot;,&quot;banana&quot;) paste(txt, &quot;fruit&quot;, sep = &quot;-&quot;) ## [1] &quot;apple-fruit&quot; &quot;pear-fruit&quot; &quot;banana-fruit&quot; # Glue them all together into a single string using the collapse argument paste(txt, collapse = &quot;-&quot;) ## [1] &quot;apple-pear-banana&quot; # Combine numbers and text: paste(&quot;Question&quot;, 1:3) ## [1] &quot;Question 1&quot; &quot;Question 2&quot; &quot;Question 3&quot; # This can be of use to make new variables in a dataframe, # as in this example where we combine two factors to create a new one: pupae$T_CO2 &lt;- with(pupae, paste(T_treatment, CO2_treatment, sep=&quot;-&quot;)) head(pupae$T_CO2) ## [1] &quot;ambient-280&quot; &quot;ambient-280&quot; &quot;ambient-280&quot; &quot;ambient-280&quot; &quot;ambient-280&quot; ## [6] &quot;ambient-280&quot; Run the final example above, and inspect the variable T_CO2 (with str) that we added to the dataframe. Make it into a factor variable using as.factor, and inspect the variable again. 3.7.4.2 Text in dataframes and grep When you read in a dataset (with read.csv, read.table or similar), any variable that R cannot convert to numeric is automatically converted to a factor. This means that if a column has even just one value that is text (or some garble that does not represent a number), the column cannot be numeric. When you want non-numeric columns to be read in as character instead of factor, you must do: cereals &lt;- read.csv(&quot;cereals.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) Here, the argument stringsAsFactors=FALSE avoided the automatic conversion of character variables to factors. While we know that factors are very useful, sometimes we want a variable to be treated like text. For example, if we plan to analyse text directly, or extract numbers or other information from bits of text. Let’s look at a few examples using the titanic dataset. # Load dataset data(titanic) # Is passenger name stored as a character? is.character(titanic$Name) ## [1] FALSE # Evidently not. We can convert it to character: titanic$Name &lt;- as.character(titanic$Name) # ... or as part of a dplyr chain: titanic &lt;- titanic %&gt;% mutate(Name = as.character(Name)) The following example uses grep, a very powerful function. This function can make use of regular expressions, a flexible tool for text processing. # Extract cereal names (for convenience). data(cereals) cerealnames &lt;- cereals$Cereal.name # Find the cereals that have &#39;Raisin&#39; in them. # grep() returns the index of values that contain Raisin grep(&quot;Raisin&quot;,cerealnames) ## [1] 23 45 46 50 52 53 59 60 61 71 # grepl() returns TRUE or FALSE grepl(&quot;Raisin&quot;,cerealnames) ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [12] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [23] TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [34] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [45] TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE ## [56] FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [67] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE # That result just gives you the indices of the vector that have &#39;Raisin&#39; in them. # these are the corresponding names: cerealnames[grep(&quot;Raisin&quot;,cerealnames)] ## [1] &quot;Crispy_Wheat_&amp;_Raisins&quot; ## [2] &quot;Muesli_Raisins,_Dates,_&amp;_Almonds&quot; ## [3] &quot;Muesli_Raisins,_Peaches,_&amp;_Pecans&quot; ## [4] &quot;Nutri-Grain_Almond-Raisin&quot; ## [5] &quot;Oatmeal_Raisin_Crisp&quot; ## [6] &quot;Post_Nat._Raisin_Bran&quot; ## [7] &quot;Raisin_Bran&quot; ## [8] &quot;Raisin_Nut_Bran&quot; ## [9] &quot;Raisin_Squares&quot; ## [10] &quot;Total_Raisin_Bran&quot; # Now find the cereals whose name starts with Raisin. # The ^ symbol is part of a &#39;regular expression&#39;, it indicates &#39;starts with&#39;: grep(&quot;^Raisin&quot;,cerealnames) ## [1] 59 60 61 # Or end with &#39;Bran&#39; # The $ symbol is part of a &#39;regular expression&#39;, and indicates &#39;ends with&#39;: grep(&quot;Bran$&quot;, cerealnames) ## [1] 1 2 3 20 29 53 59 60 65 71 As mentioned, grep can do a lot of different things, so don’t be alarmed if you find the help page a bit overwhelming. However, there are a few options worth knowing about. One very useful option is to turn off the case-sensitivity, for example: grep(&quot;bran&quot;, cerealnames, ignore.case=TRUE) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 9 10 20 29 53 59 60 65 71 finds Bran and bran and BRAN. Finally, using the above tools, let’s add a new variable to the cereal dataset that is TRUE when the name of the cereal ends in ‘Bran’, otherwise it is FALSE. For this example, the grepl function is more useful (because it returns TRUE and FALSE). # grepl will return FALSE when Bran is not found, TRUE otherwise cereals$BranOrNot &lt;- grepl(&quot;Bran$&quot;, cerealnames) # Quick summary: table(cereals$BranOrNot) ## ## FALSE TRUE ## 67 10 A clear explanation of regular expressions is on the Wikipedia page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expressions. Also worth a look is Robin Lovelace’s introduction specifically for R and RStudio at https://www.r-bloggers.com/regular-expressions-in-r-vs-rstudio/. 3.7.4.3 More control with the stringr package In the previous section we used grep and grepl to find text in strings, which we can use to subset dataframes, or simply to find data. We can do a lot more with strings, but things get a bit difficult quickly when we stick to base R. Instead, the stringr package provides an easy-to-use interface to many common text operations. The following examples give a few very handy tips, but the package provides much more (see library(help=stringr)). library(stringr) # Extract all numbers from a string # Note that the result is a character! str_extract(&quot;I have 5 apples&quot;, &quot;[0-9]&quot;) ## [1] &quot;5&quot; # Extract the nth word from text. word(&quot;Dantchoff, Mr Khristo&quot;, 2) ## [1] &quot;Mr&quot; # Replace text that matches a pattern. # (sub or gsub from base R also work OK) str_replace(&quot;Dantchoff, Mr Khristo&quot;, &quot;Mr&quot;, &quot;Mrs&quot;) ## [1] &quot;Dantchoff, Mrs Khristo&quot; 3.7.4.4 Combining text and R objects with glue When controlling output, we often want to combine results stored in R objects, and text. As we saw in Section 3.7.4.1, we can use paste to achieve this, but there’s a better way: library(glue) data(titanic) glue(&quot;The titanic dataset has {nrow(titanic)} rows. &quot;, &quot;For {percmissing}% of the data, Age is missing.&quot;, percmissing = round(100 * mean(is.na(titanic$Age)), 1)) ## The titanic dataset has 1313 rows. For 42.4% of the data, Age is missing. With glue, we can include both R code directly within {} (as we did with nrow(titanic)), and also use temporary variables (here: percmissing) that are given as extra arguments. Also note that strings separated by , are pasted together by glue. 3.7.5 Working with dates and times Admittedly, working with dates and times in R is somewhat annoying at first. The built-in help files on this subject describe all aspects of this special data type, but do not offer much for the beginning R user. This section covers basic operations that you may need when analysing and formatting datasets. For working with dates, we use the lubridate package, which simplifies it tremendously. 3.7.5.1 Reading dates The built-in Date class in R is encoded as an integer number representing the number of days since 1-1-1970 (but this actual origin does not matter for the user). Converting a character string to a date with as.Date is straightforward if you use the standard order of dates: YYYY-MM-DD. So, for example, as.Date(&quot;2008-5-22&quot;) ## [1] &quot;2008-05-22&quot; The output here is not interesting, R simply prints the date. Because dates are represented as numbers in R, we can do basic arithmetic: # First load lubridate when working with dates or date-time combinations. # (as.Date and difftime are part of the base package, but lubridate provides # years(), months(), and many more functions used below). library(lubridate) # A date, 7 days later: as.Date(&quot;2011-5-12&quot;) + 7 ## [1] &quot;2011-05-19&quot; # Difference between dates. as.Date(&quot;2009-7-1&quot;) - as.Date(&quot;2008-12-1&quot;) ## Time difference of 212 days # With difftime, you can specify the units: difftime(as.Date(&quot;2009-7-1&quot;), as.Date(&quot;2008-12-1&quot;), units = &quot;weeks&quot;) ## Time difference of 30.28571 weeks # To add other timespans, use functions months(), years() or weeks() to # avoid problems with leap years as.Date(&quot;2013-8-18&quot;) + years(10) + months(1) ## [1] &quot;2023-09-18&quot; The previous example showed a very useful trick for adding numbers to a Date to get a new Date a few days later. Confirm for yourself that this method accounts for leap years. That is, the day before 2011-3-1 should be 2011-2-28 (2011 is not a leap year). But what about 2012-3-1? Often, text strings representing the date are not in the standard format. Fortunately, it is possible to convert any reasonable sequence to a Date object in R. All we have to do is provide a character string to as.Date and tell the function the order of the fields. To convert any format to a Date, we can use the lubridate package, which contains the functions ymd, mdy, and all other combinations of y, m, and d. These functions are pretty smart, as can be seen in these examples: # Day / month / year as.Date(dmy(&quot;31/12/1991&quot;)) ## [1] &quot;1991-12-31&quot; # Month - day - year (note, only two digits for the year) as.Date(mdy(&quot;4-17-92&quot;)) ## [1] &quot;1992-04-17&quot; # Year month day as.Date(ymd(&quot;1976-5-22&quot;)) ## [1] &quot;1976-05-22&quot; #-- Unusual formatting can be read in with the &#39;format&#39; argument # in as.Date. See ?strptime for a list of codes. # For example, Year and day of year (&quot;%j&quot; stands for &#39;Julian date&#39;) as.Date(&quot;2011 121&quot;, format=&quot;%Y %j&quot;) ## [1] &quot;2011-05-01&quot; Another method to construct date objects is when you do not have a character string as in the above example, but separate numeric variables for year, month and day. In this case, use the ISOdate function: as.Date(ISOdate(2008,12,2)) ## [1] &quot;2008-12-02&quot; Finally, here is a simple way to find the number of days since you were born, using today from the lubridate package. # Today&#39;s date (and time) can be with the today() function today() ## [1] &quot;2019-10-30&quot; # We can now simply subtract your birthday from today&#39;s date. today() - as.Date(&quot;1976-5-22&quot;) ## Time difference of 15866 days 3.7.5.2 Example: using dates in a dataframe The as.Date function that we met in the previous section also works with vectors of dates, and the Date class can also be part of a dataframe. Let’s take a look at the Hydro data to practice working with dates. # Load the hydro dataset data(hydro) # Now convert this to a Date variable. # If you first inspect head(hydro$Date), you will see the format is DD/MM/YYYY hydro$Date &lt;- as.Date(dmy(hydro$Date)) If any of the date conversions go wrong, the dmy function (or its equivalents) should print a message letting you know. You can double check if any of the converted dates is NA like this: any(is.na(hydro$Date)) ## [1] FALSE We now have successfully read in the date variable. The min and max functions are useful to check the range of dates in the dataset: # Minimum and maximum date (that is, oldest and most recent), min(hydro$Date) ## [1] &quot;2005-08-08&quot; max(hydro$Date) ## [1] &quot;2011-08-08&quot; #... and length of measurement period: max(hydro$Date) - min(hydro$Date) ## Time difference of 2191 days Finally, the Date class is very handy when plotting. Let’s make a simple graph of the Hydro dataset. The following code produces Fig. 3.1. Note how the X axis is automatically formatted to display the date in a (fairly) pretty way. ggplot(hydro, aes(x = Date, y = storage)) + geom_line() Figure 3.1: A simple plot of the hydro data. 3.7.5.3 Date-Time combinations For dates that include the time, R has a special class called POSIXct. The lubridate package makes it easy to work with this class. Internally, a date-time is represented as the number of seconds since the 1st of January, 1970. Time zones are also supported, but we will not use this functionality in this book (as it can be quite confusing). From the lubridate package, we can use any combination of (y)ear,(m)onth,(d)ay, (h)our, (m)inutes, (s)econds. For example ymd_hms converts a character string in that order. Let’s look at some examples, # Load lubridate library(lubridate) # The standard format is YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS ymd_hms(&quot;2012-9-16 13:05:00&quot;) ## [1] &quot;2012-09-16 13:05:00 UTC&quot; # Read two times (note the first has no seconds, so we can use ymd_hm) time1 &lt;- ymd_hm(&quot;2008-5-21 9:05&quot;) time2 &lt;- ymd_hms(&quot;2012-9-16 13:05:00&quot;) # Time difference: time2 - time1 ## Time difference of 1579.167 days # And an example with a different format, DD/M/YY H:MM dmy_hm(&quot;23-1-89 4:30&quot;) ## [1] &quot;1989-01-23 04:30:00 UTC&quot; # To convert a date-time to a Date, you can also use the as.Date function, # which will simply drop the time. as.Date(time1) ## [1] &quot;2008-05-21&quot; As with Date objects, we can calculate timespans using a few handy functions. # What time is it 3 hours and 15 minutes from now? now() + hours(3) + minutes(15) ## [1] &quot;2019-10-31 00:00:58 CET&quot; The 2012 Sydney marathon started at 7:20AM on September 16th. The winner completed the race in 2 hours, 11 minutes and 50 seconds. What was the time when the racer crossed the finish line? Using the weekdays function, which day was the race held? 3.7.5.4 Example: date-times in a dataframe Now let’s use a real dataset to practice the use of date-times. We also introduce the functions month, yday, hour and minute to conveniently extract components of date-time objects. The last command produces Fig. 3.2. # Read the 2008 met dataset from the HFE. data(hfemet2008) # Convert &#39;DateTime&#39; to POSIXct class. # The order of the original data is MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM # We also add various date and time fields to the dataframe. hfemet &lt;- hfemet2008 %&gt;% mutate(DateTime = mdy_hm(DateTime), Date = as.Date(DateTime), DOY = yday(DateTime), hour = hour(DateTime), minute = minute(DateTime), month = month(DateTime)) # Make sure all datetimes were converted OK (if not, NAs would be produced) any(is.na(hfemet$DateTime)) ## [1] FALSE # FALSE is good here! # Make a simple line plot for data from one month. filter(hfemet, month == 6) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = DateTime, y = Tair)) + geom_line() Figure 3.2: Air temperature for June at the HFE # We can also take a subset of just one day, using the Date variable we added: hfemet_oneday &lt;- filter(hfemet, Date == as.Date(&quot;2008-11-1&quot;)) 3.7.5.5 Sequences of dates and times It is often useful to generate sequences of dates. We can use seq as we do for numeric variables (as we already saw in Section 3.2.1). # A series of dates, by day: seq(from=as.Date(&quot;2011-1-1&quot;), to=as.Date(&quot;2011-1-5&quot;), by=&quot;day&quot;) ## [1] &quot;2011-01-01&quot; &quot;2011-01-02&quot; &quot;2011-01-03&quot; &quot;2011-01-04&quot; &quot;2011-01-05&quot; # Two-weekly dates: seq(from=as.Date(&quot;2011-1-1&quot;), length=4, by=&quot;2 weeks&quot;) ## [1] &quot;2011-01-01&quot; &quot;2011-01-15&quot; &quot;2011-01-29&quot; &quot;2011-02-12&quot; # Monthly: seq(from=as.Date(&quot;2011-12-13&quot;), length=4, by=&quot;months&quot;) ## [1] &quot;2011-12-13&quot; &quot;2012-01-13&quot; &quot;2012-02-13&quot; &quot;2012-03-13&quot; Similarly, you can generate sequences of date-times. # Generate a sequence with 30 min timestep: # Here, the &#39;by&#39; field specifies the timestep in seconds. fromtime &lt;- ymd_hm(&quot;2012-6-1 14:30&quot;) seq(from=fromtime, length=3, by=30*60) ## [1] &quot;2012-06-01 14:30:00 UTC&quot; &quot;2012-06-01 15:00:00 UTC&quot; ## [3] &quot;2012-06-01 15:30:00 UTC&quot; 3.7.6 Converting between data types It is often useful, or even necessary, to convert from one data type to another. For example, when you read in data with read.csv or read.table, any column that contains some non-numeric values (that is, values that cannot be converted to a number) will be converted to a factor variable. Sometimes you actually want to convert it to numeric, which will result in some missing values (NA) when the value could not be converted to a number. Another common example is when one of your variables should be read in as a factor variable (for example, a column with treatment codes), but because all the values are numeric, R will simply assume it is a numeric column. Before we learn how to convert, it is useful to make sure you know what type of data you have to begin with. To find out what type of data a particular vector is, we use str (this is also useful for any other object in R). # Numeric y &lt;- c(1,100,10) str(y) ## num [1:3] 1 100 10 # This example also shows the dimension of the vector ([1:3]). # Character x &lt;- &quot;sometext&quot; str(x) ## chr &quot;sometext&quot; # Factor p &lt;- factor(c(&quot;apple&quot;,&quot;banana&quot;)) str(p) ## Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;apple&quot;,&quot;banana&quot;: 1 2 # Logical z &lt;- c(TRUE,FALSE) str(z) ## logi [1:2] TRUE FALSE # Date sometime &lt;- as.Date(&quot;1979-9-16&quot;) str(sometime) ## Date[1:1], format: &quot;1979-09-16&quot; # Date-Time library(lubridate) onceupon &lt;- ymd_hm(&quot;1969-8-18 09:00&quot;) str(onceupon) ## POSIXct[1:1], format: &quot;1969-08-18 09:00:00&quot; To test for a particular type of data, use the is.*something* functions, which give TRUE if the object is of that type, for example: # Test for numeric data type: is.numeric(c(10,189)) ## [1] TRUE # Test for character: is.character(&quot;HIE&quot;) ## [1] TRUE We can convert between types with the as.*something* class of functions. # First we make six example values that we will use to convert mynum &lt;- 1001 mychar &lt;- c(&quot;1001&quot;,&quot;100 apples&quot;) myfac &lt;- factor(c(&quot;280&quot;,&quot;400&quot;,&quot;650&quot;)) mylog &lt;- c(TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE) mydate &lt;- as.Date(&quot;2015-03-18&quot;) mydatetime &lt;- ymd_hm(&quot;2011-8-11 16:00&quot;) # A few examples: # Convert to character as.character(mynum) ## [1] &quot;1001&quot; as.character(myfac) ## [1] &quot;280&quot; &quot;400&quot; &quot;650&quot; # Convert to numeric # Note that one missing value is created as.numeric(mychar) ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion ## [1] 1001 NA # Warning!!! # When converting from a factor to numeric, first convert to character # !!! as.numeric(as.character(myfac)) ## [1] 280 400 650 # Convert to Date as.Date(mydatetime) ## [1] &quot;2011-08-11&quot; # Convert to factor as.factor(mylog) ## [1] TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE ## Levels: FALSE TRUE When converting a factor to numeric (i.e. when the factor labels can be converted to numeric values), first convert it to character: x &lt;- as.numeric(as.character(somefactor)). The reason for this is that factor variables are internally stored as integer numbers, referring to the levels of the factor. 3.8 Exercises 3.8.1 Working with a single vector - indexing Recall Exercise 2.13.3. Load the rainfall data once more. We now practice subsetting a vector (see Section 3.5.1). 1. Take a subset of the rainfall data where rain is larger than 20. 2. What is the mean rainfall for days where the rainfall was at least 4? 3. Subset the vector where it is either exactly zero, or exactly 0.6. 3.8.2 Alphabet aerobics 2 The 26 letters of the Roman alphabet are conveniently accessible in R via letters and LETTERS. These are not functions, but vectors that are always loaded. 1. What is the 18th letter of the alphabet? 2. What is the last letter of the alphabet (pretend you don’t know the alphabet has 26 letters)? 3. Use ?sample to figure out how to sample with replacement. Generate a random subset of fifteen letters. Are any letters in the subset duplicated? Hint: use the any and duplicated functions. Which letters? 3.8.3 Basic operations with the Cereals data First read or otherwise understand Section 3.4.2. For this exercise, we will use the cereals dataset (from the lgrdata package, use data(cereals) to load it). 1. Read in the dataset, look at the first few rows with head and inspect the data types of the variables in the dataframe with str. 2. Add a new variable to the dataset called totalcarb, which is the sum of carbo and sugars. You can do this is in (at least) three ways! (One of which is mutate from dplyr - a good idea to start using this powerful function). 3. How many cereals in the dataframe are ‘hot’ cereals? Either make a subset and count the rows, or subset the Cold.or.Hot vector directly, and determine its length (do not use table yet, or a similar function!). 4. How many unique manufacturers are included in the dataset? Hint: use length and unique. 5. Now try the n_distinct function from dplyr. 6. Take a subset of the dataframe of all cereals that have less than 80 calories, AND have more than 20 units of vitamins. 7. Take a subset of the dataframe containing cereals that contain at least 1 unit of sugar, and keep only the variables ‘Cereal.name’, ‘calories’ and ‘vitamins’. Then inspect the first few rows of the dataframe with head. 8. For one of the above subsets, write a new CSV file to disk using write.csv (see Section 3.6). 9. Rename the column ‘Manufacturer’ to ‘Producer’ (see Section 3.4.3). 3.8.4 A short dataset 1. Read the following data into R (number of cuckoos seen in a week by an avid birdwatcher). Give the resulting dataframe a reasonable name. Hint:To read this dataset, look at Section 3.3.4 for a possibility (there are at least two ways to read this dataset, or you can type it into Excel and save as a CSV file if you prefer). Day nrbirds sunday 3 monday 2 tuesday 5 wednesday 0 thursday 8 friday 1 saturday 2 2. Add a day number to the dataset you read in above (sunday=1, saturday=7). Recall the seq function (Section 3.2.1). 3. Delete the ‘Day’ variable (to only keep the daynumber that you added above). 4. On which daynumber did you observe the most honeyeaters? Hint: use which.max, in combination with indexing. 5. Sort the dataset by number of birds seen. Hint: use the order function to find the order of the number of birds, then use this vector to index the dataframe. 3.8.5 Titanic - Part 1 1. Read the titanic data from the lgrdata package. 2. Make two new dataframes : a subset of male survivors, and a subset of female survivors. Recall Section 3.5.2. Use filter from dplyr. 3. Based on the previous question, what was the name of the oldest surviving male? In what class was the youngest surviving female? Hint: use which.max, which.min on the subsets you just created. The easiest solution here is to use square bracket notation, but you can also solve this question in steps. 4. Take 15 random names of passengers from the Titanic, and sort them alphabetically. Hint: use sort. 3.8.6 Titanic - Part 2 1. Convert the ‘Name’ (passenger name) variable to a ‘character’ variable, and store it in the dataframe. See Section 3.7.4.2. 2. How many observations of ‘Age’ are missing from the dataframe? See examples in Section 3.7.3. 3. Make a new variable called ‘Status’, based on the ‘Survived’ variable already in the dataset. For passengers that did not survive, Status should be ‘dead’, for those who did, Status should be ‘alive’. Make sure this new variable is a factor. See the example with the ifelse function in Section 3.7.1. 4. Count the number of passengers in each class (1st, 2nd, 3rd). Hint: use table as shown in Section 3.7.1. 5. Using grep, find the six passengers with the last name ‘Fortune’. Make this subset into a new dataframe. Did they all survive? Hint: to do this, make sure you recall how to use one vector to index a dataframe (see Section 3.5.2). Also, the all function might be useful here (see Section 3.7.2). 6. As in 2., for what proportion of the passengers is the age unknown? Was this proportion higher for 3rd class than 1st and 2nd? Hint: First make a subset of the dataframe where age is missing (see Section 3.7.3.3), and then use table, as well as nrow. 3.8.7 Hydro dam Use the hydro dam data (used in Section 3.7.5.2). 1. Start by reading in the data. Change the first variable to a Date class (see Section 3.7.5.1). 2. Are the successive measurements in the dataset always exactly one week apart? Hint: use diff. 3. Assume that a dangerously low level of the dam is 235 \\(Gwh\\). How many weeks was the dam level equal to or lower than this value? 4. (Hard question). For question 2., how many times did storage decrease below 235 (regardless of how long it remained below 235)? Hint: use diff and subset). 3.8.8 HFE tree measurements Use the data for an experiment where trees were irrigated and/or fertilized (the hfeplotmeans dataset). 1. Read the data, write a copy to a new object called trees (easier to type!) and look at various summaries of the dataset. Use summary, str and describe (the latter is in the Hmisc package). 2. From these summaries, find out how many missing values there are for height and diameter. Also count the number of missing values as shown in Section 3.7.3. 3. Inspect the levels of the treatment (treat), with the levels function. Also count the number of levels with the nlevels function. Now assign new levels to the factor, replacing the abbreviations with a more informative label. Follow the example in Section 3.7.1.3. 4. Using table, count the number of observations by treat, to check if the dataset is balanced. Be aware that table simply counts the number of rows, regardless of missing values. Now take a subset of the dataset where height is not missing, and check the number of observations again. 5. For which dates do missing values occur in height in this dataset? Hint: use a combination of is.na and unique. 3.8.9 Flux data In this exercise, you will practice working with Dates and Date-Time combinations, with a timeseries dataset (the fluxtower dataset from the lgrdata package). In this dataset, a new row was produced every 30min - of various meteorological measurements above a forest in Spain. For example, FCO2 is the flux of carbon dioxide out of forest, so that negative values indicate photosynthesis. 1. Read the dataframe. Rename the first column to ‘DateTime’ (recall Section 3.4.3). 2. Convert DateTime to a POSIXct class. Beware of the formatting (recall Section 3.7.5.3). 3. Did the above action produce any missing values? Were these already missing in the original dataset? 4. Add a variable to the dataset called ‘Quality’. This variable should be ‘bad’ when the variable ‘ustar’ is less than 0.15, and ‘good’ otherwise. Recall the example in Section 3.7.1. 5. Add a ‘month’ column to the dataset, as well as ‘year’. 6. Look at the ‘Rain’ column. There are some problems; re-read the data or find another way to display NA whenever the data have an invalid value. Hint: look at the argument na.strings in read.table. Did it rain on this forest in Spain? 3.8.10 DNA Aerobics DNA sequences can also be represented using text strings. In this exercise, you will make an artificial DNA sequence. 1. Make a random DNA sequence, consisting of a 100 random selections of the letters C,A,G,T, and paste the result together into one character string (Hint : use sample as in Section 3.2.2 with replacement, and use paste as shown in Section 3.7.4. Write it in one line of R code. "],

We already looked at summary and str in Section 3.4. Two more very useful functions are from the Hmisc package. The first, describe, is much like summary, but offers slightly more sophisticated statistics. The second, contents, is similar to str, but does a very nice job of summarizing the factor variables in your dataframe, prints the number of missing variables, the number of rows, and so on. # Load data data(pupae) # Make sure CO2_treatment is a factor (it will be read as a number) pupae$CO2_treatment &lt;- as.factor(pupae$CO2_treatment) # Show contents: library(Hmisc) contents(pupae) ## ## Data frame:pupae 84 observations and 5 variables Maximum # NAs:6 ## ## ## Levels Storage NAs ## T_treatment 2 integer 0 ## CO2_treatment 2 integer 0 ## Gender integer 6 ## PupalWeight double 0 ## Frass double 1 ## ## +-------------+----------------+ ## |Variable |Levels | ## +-------------+----------------+ ## |T_treatment |ambient,elevated| ## +-------------+----------------+ ## |CO2_treatment|280,400 | ## +-------------+----------------+ Here, storage refers to the internal storage type of the variable: note that the factor variables are stored as ‘integer’, and other numbers as ‘double’ (this refers to the precision of the number). 4.1.1 Making summary tables 4.1.1.1 Summarizing vectors with tapply If we have the following dataset called plantdat, and execute the command with(plantdat, tapply(Plantbiomass, Treatment, mean)) we get the result Note that the result is a vector (elements of a vector can have names, like columns of a dataframe). If we have the following dataset called plantdat2, and execute the command with(plantdat2, tapply(Plantbiomass, list(Species, Treatment), mean)) we get the result Note that the result here is a matrix, where A and B, the species codes, are the rownames of this matrix. Often, you want to summarize a variable by the levels of another variable. For example, in the rain data, the Rain variable gives daily values, but we might want to calculate annual sums, # Read data data(rain) # Annual rain totals. with(rain, tapply(Rain, Year, FUN=sum)) ## 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 ## 717.2 640.4 905.4 1021.3 693.5 791.5 645.9 691.8 709.5 678.2 The tapply function applies a function (sum) to a vector (Rain), that is split into chunks depending on another variable (Year). We can also use the tapply function on more than one variable at a time. Consider these examples on the pupae data. # Average pupal weight by CO2 and T treatment: with(pupae, tapply(PupalWeight, list(CO2_treatment, T_treatment), FUN=mean)) ## ambient elevated ## 280 0.2900000 0.30492 ## 400 0.3419565 0.29900 # Further split the averages, by gender of the pupae. with(pupae, tapply(PupalWeight, list(CO2_treatment, T_treatment, Gender), FUN=mean)) ## , , 0 ## ## ambient elevated ## 280 0.251625 0.2700000 ## 400 0.304000 0.2687143 ## ## , , 1 ## ## ambient elevated ## 280 0.3406000 0.3386364 ## 400 0.3568333 0.3692857 As the examples show, the tapply function produces summary tables by one or more factors. The resulting object is either a vector (when using one factor), or a matrix (as in the examples using the pupae data). The limitations of tapply are that you can only summarize one variable at a time, and that the result is not a dataframe. The main advantage of tapply is that we can use it as input to barplot, as the following example demonstrates (Fig. fig:pupgroupedbar}) # Pupal weight by CO2 and Gender. Result is a matrix. pupm &lt;- with(pupae, tapply(PupalWeight, list(CO2_treatment,Gender), mean, na.rm=TRUE)) # When barplot is provided a matrix, it makes a grouped barplot. # We specify xlim to make some room for the legend. barplot(pupm, beside=TRUE, legend.text=TRUE, xlim=c(0,8), xlab=&quot;Gender&quot;, ylab=&quot;Pupal weight&quot;) Figure 4.1: A grouped barplot of average pupal weight by CO2 and Gender for the pupae dataset. This is easily achieved via the use of tapply. 4.1.1.2 Quick summary tables with summaryBy If we have the following dataset called plantdat, and execute the command library(doBy) summaryBy(Plantbiomass ~ treatment, FUN=mean, data=plantdat) we get the result Note that the result here is a dataframe. If we have the following dataset called plantdat2, and execute the command summaryBy(Plantbiomass ~ Species + Treatment, FUN=mean, data=dfr) we get the result Note that the result here is a dataframe. In practice, it is often useful to make summary tables of multiple variables at once, and to end up with a dataframe. In this book we first use summaryBy, from the doBy package, to achieve this. With summaryBy, we can generate multiple summaries (mean, standard deviation, etc.) on more than one variable in a dataframe at once. We can use a convenient formula interface for this. It is of the form, summaryBy(Yvar1 + Yvar2 ~ Groupvar1 + Groupvar2, FUN=c(mean,sd), data=mydata) where we summarize the (numeric) variables Yvar1 and Yvar2 by all combinations of the (factor) variables Groupvar1 and Groupvar2. # Load the doBy package library(doBy) # read pupae data if you have not already data(pupae) # Get mean and standard deviation of Frass by CO2 and T treatments summaryBy(Frass ~ CO2_treatment + T_treatment, data=pupae, FUN=c(mean,sd)) ## CO2_treatment T_treatment Frass.mean Frass.sd ## 1 280 ambient NA NA ## 2 280 elevated 1.479520 0.2387150 ## 3 400 ambient 2.121783 0.4145402 ## 4 400 elevated 1.912045 0.3597471 # Note that there is a missing value. We can specify na.rm=TRUE, # which will be passed to both mean() and sd(). It works because those # functions recognize that argument (i.e. na.rm is NOT an argument of # summaryBy itself!) summaryBy(Frass ~ CO2_treatment + T_treatment, data=pupae, FUN=c(mean,sd), na.rm=TRUE) ## CO2_treatment T_treatment Frass.mean Frass.sd ## 1 280 ambient 1.953923 0.4015635 ## 2 280 elevated 1.479520 0.2387150 ## 3 400 ambient 2.121783 0.4145402 ## 4 400 elevated 1.912045 0.3597471 # However, if we use a function that does not recognize it, we first have to # exclude all missing values before making a summary table, like this: pupae_nona &lt;- pupae[complete.cases(pupae),] # Get mean and standard deviation for # the pupae data (Pupal weight and Frass), by CO2 and T treatment. # Note that length() does not recognize na.rm (see ?length), which is # why we have excluded any NA from pupae first. summaryBy(PupalWeight+Frass ~ CO2_treatment + T_treatment, data=pupae_nona, FUN=c(mean,sd,length)) ## CO2_treatment T_treatment PupalWeight.mean Frass.mean PupalWeight.sd ## 1 280 ambient 0.2912500 1.957333 0.04895847 ## 2 280 elevated 0.3014583 1.473167 0.05921000 ## 3 400 ambient 0.3357000 2.103250 0.05886479 ## 4 400 elevated 0.3022381 1.931000 0.06602189 ## Frass.sd PupalWeight.length Frass.length ## 1 0.4192227 12 12 ## 2 0.2416805 24 24 ## 3 0.4186310 20 20 ## 4 0.3571969 21 21 You can also use any function that returns a vector of results. In the following example we calculate the 5% and 95% quantiles of all numeric variables in the allometry dataset. To do this, use . for the left-hand side of the formula. # . ~ species means &#39;all numeric variables by species&#39;. # Extra arguments to the function used (in this case quantile) can be set here as well, # they will be passed to that function (see ?quantile). data(allometry) summaryBy(. ~ species, data=allometry, FUN=quantile, probs=c(0.05, 0.95)) ## species diameter.5% diameter.95% height.5% height.95% leafarea.5% ## 1 PIMO 8.1900 70.9150 5.373000 44.675 7.540916 ## 2 PIPO 11.4555 69.1300 5.903499 39.192 10.040843 ## 3 PSME 6.1635 56.5385 5.276000 32.602 4.988747 ## leafarea.95% branchmass.5% branchmass.95% ## 1 380.3984 4.283342 333.6408 ## 2 250.1295 7.591966 655.1097 ## 3 337.5367 3.515638 403.7902 4.1.1.3 Summarizing dataframes with dplyr We started with the summaryBy package, since it is so easy to use. A more modern and popular approach is to use dplyr for all your dataframe summarizing needs. The main advantage is that dplyr is very, very fast. For datasets with &gt; hundreds of thousands of rows, you will notice an incredible speed increase. For millions of rows, you really have to use dplyr (or data.table, but we don’t cover that package in this book). Making summary tables as we did in the above examples requires two steps: Group your dataframe by one or more factor variables Apply summarizing functions to each of the groups As is the norm, we use the pipe operator (%&gt;%) to keep the steps apart. Here is a simple example to get started. library(dplyr) group_by(pupae, CO2_treatment, T_treatment) %&gt;% summarize(Frass_mean = mean(Frass, na.rm=TRUE), Frass_sd = sd(Frass, na.rm=TRUE)) ## # A tibble: 4 x 4 ## # Groups: CO2_treatment [2] ## CO2_treatment T_treatment Frass_mean Frass_sd ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 280 ambient 1.95 0.402 ## 2 280 elevated 1.48 0.239 ## 3 400 ambient 2.12 0.415 ## 4 400 elevated 1.91 0.360 I used as.data.frame at the end, so we arrive at an actual dataframe, not a tibble (only for the reason so you can compare the output to the previous examples). The dplyr package (and others) always produce tibbles, which are really just dataframes but with some adjusted printing methods. In summarize you can specify each of the new variables that should be produced, in this case giving mean and standard deviation of Frass. If we want to apply a number of functions over many variables, we can use summarize_at, like so: group_by(pupae, CO2_treatment, T_treatment) %&gt;% summarize_at(.vars = c(&quot;Frass&quot;, &quot;PupalWeight&quot;), .funs = c(&quot;mean&quot;, &quot;sd&quot;)) ## # A tibble: 4 x 6 ## # Groups: CO2_treatment [2] ## CO2_treatment T_treatment Frass_mean PupalWeight_mean Frass_sd ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 280 ambient NA 0.290 NaN ## 2 280 elevated 1.48 0.305 0.239 ## 3 400 ambient 2.12 0.342 0.415 ## 4 400 elevated 1.91 0.299 0.360 ## # ... with 1 more variable: PupalWeight_sd &lt;dbl&gt; The result is identical to our last example with summaryBy. Let’s look at a more advanced example using weather data collected at the Hawkesbury Forest Experiment in 2008. The data given are in half-hourly time steps. It is a reasonable request to provide data as daily averages (for temperature) and daily sums (for precipitation). The following code produces a daily weather dataset, and Fig. 4.2. # Read data, convert DateTime field to a proper Datetime class using # lubridate&#39;s mdy_hm function, and add a Date column with as.Date. # Instead of loading packages, we use :: in the example below to make sure # the functions are used from the right package. data(hfemet2008) hfemet_agg &lt;- hfemet2008 %&gt;% mutate(DateTime = lubridate::mdy_hm(DateTime), Date = as.Date(DateTime)) %&gt;% group_by(Date) %&gt;% summarize(Rain = sum(Rain), Tair = mean(Tair)) # A simple plot of daily rainfall. library(ggplot2) ggplot(hfemet_agg, aes(x = Date, y = Rain)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) Figure 4.2: Daily rainfall at the HFE in 2008 4.1.1.4 Using padr to aggregate timeseries data In the previous example we saw a quick and concise methods to aggregate and filter a dataframe that includes a single date-time column (here roughly referred to as timeseries data). In the example, we calculated daily totals and averages, but what if we want to aggregate by other timespans, like two-week intervals, 6 months, or 15 minutes? The padr package is very convenient for this sort of mutation. The following example uses padr in combination with several functions from dplyr to make a table of total rainfall in 4 hour increments for one day, using the hfemet2008 dataset. library(dplyr) library(padr) library(lubridate) # From the lgrdata package data(hfemet2008) mutate(hfemet2008, DateTime = mdy_hm(DateTime)) %&gt;% # convert to proper DateTime filter(as.Date(DateTime) == &quot;2008-6-3&quot;) %&gt;% # select a single day thicken(&quot;4 hours&quot;, round=&quot;down&quot;) %&gt;% # add datetime in 4hour steps group_by(DateTime_4_hour) %&gt;% # set grouping variable summarize(Rain = sum(Rain)) %&gt;% # sum over the grouping variable select(DateTime = DateTime_4_hour, Rain) # show two variables ## # A tibble: 6 x 2 ## DateTime Rain ## &lt;dttm&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2008-06-03 00:00:00 2.4 ## 2 2008-06-03 04:00:00 1.8 ## 3 2008-06-03 08:00:00 11.8 ## 4 2008-06-03 12:00:00 5.6 ## 5 2008-06-03 16:00:00 6.6 ## 6 2008-06-03 20:00:00 26.4 4.1.2 Tables of counts It is often useful to count the number of observations by one or more multiple factors. One option is to use tapply or summaryBy in combination with the length function. A much better alternative is to use the xtabs and ftable functions, in addition to the simple use of table. Alternatively, dplyr provides a count function. We will look at both options. Consider these examples using the Titanic data. # Read titanic data data(titanic) # Count observations by passenger class table(titanic$PClass) ## ## 1st 2nd 3rd ## 322 280 711 # With more grouping variables, it is more convenient to use xtabs. # Count observations by combinations of passenger class, sex, and whether they survived: xtabs( ~ PClass + Sex + Survived, data=titanic) ## , , Survived = 0 ## ## Sex ## PClass female male ## 1st 9 120 ## 2nd 13 148 ## 3rd 132 441 ## ## , , Survived = 1 ## ## Sex ## PClass female male ## 1st 134 59 ## 2nd 94 25 ## 3rd 80 58 # The previous output is hard to read, consider using ftable on the result: ftable(xtabs( ~ PClass + Sex + Survived, data=titanic)) ## Survived 0 1 ## PClass Sex ## 1st female 9 134 ## male 120 59 ## 2nd female 13 94 ## male 148 25 ## 3rd female 132 80 ## male 441 58 # Using dplyr, the result is a dataframe (actually, a tibble) library(dplyr) titanic %&gt;% count(PClass, Sex, Survived) ## # A tibble: 12 x 4 ## PClass Sex Survived n ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1st female 0 9 ## 2 1st female 1 134 ## 3 1st male 0 120 ## 4 1st male 1 59 ## 5 2nd female 0 13 ## 6 2nd female 1 94 ## 7 2nd male 0 148 ## 8 2nd male 1 25 ## 9 3rd female 0 132 ## 10 3rd female 1 80 ## 11 3rd male 0 441 ## 12 3rd male 1 58 4.1.3 Adding summary variables to dataframes We saw how tapply can make simple tables of averages (or totals, or other functions) of some variable by the levels of one or more factor variables. The result of tapply is typically a vector with a length equal to the number of levels of the factor you summarized by (see examples in Section 4.1.1.1). Consider the allometry dataset, which includes tree height for three species. Suppose you want to add a new variable ‘MaxHeight’, that is the maximum tree height observed per species. We can use ave to achieve this: # Read data allom &lt;- allometry %&gt;% mutate(MaxHeight = ave(height, species, FUN=max)) # Look at first few rows (or just type allom to see whole dataset) head(allom) ## species diameter height leafarea branchmass MaxHeight ## 1 PSME 54.61 27.04 338.485622 410.24638 33.3 ## 2 PSME 34.80 27.42 122.157864 83.65030 33.3 ## 3 PSME 24.89 21.23 3.958274 3.51270 33.3 ## 4 PSME 28.70 24.96 86.350653 73.13027 33.3 ## 5 PSME 34.80 29.99 63.350906 62.39044 33.3 ## 6 PSME 37.85 28.07 61.372765 53.86594 33.3 Note that you can use any function in place of max, as long as that function can take a vector as an argument, and returns a single number. If you want results similar to ave, you can use summaryBy with the argument full.dimension=TRUE. Try summaryBy on the pupae dataset with that argument set, and compare the result to full.dimension=FALSE, which is the default. 4.1.4 Reordering factor levels based on a summary variable It is often useful to tabulate your data in a meaningful order. We saw that, when using summaryBy, tapply or similar functions, that the results are always in the order of your factor levels. Recall that the default order is alphabetical. This is rarely what you want. You can reorder the factor levels by some summary variable. For example, # Reorder factor levels for &#39;Manufacturer&#39; in the cereal data # by the mean amount of sodium. # Read data, show default (alphabetical) levels: data(cereals) levels(cereals$Manufacturer) ## [1] &quot;A&quot; &quot;G&quot; &quot;K&quot; &quot;N&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;Q&quot; &quot;R&quot; # Now reorder: cereals &lt;- mutate(cereals, Manufacturer = reorder(Manufacturer, sodium, median, na.rm=TRUE)) # And inspect the new levels levels(cereals$Manufacturer) ## [1] &quot;A&quot; &quot;N&quot; &quot;Q&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;K&quot; &quot;G&quot; &quot;R&quot; # Tables are now printed in order: with(cereals, tapply(sodium, Manufacturer, median)) ## A N Q P K G R ## 0.0 7.5 75.0 160.0 170.0 200.0 200.0 This trick comes in handy when making barplots; it is customary to plot them in ascending order if there is no specific order to the factor levels, as in this example. The following code produces Fig. 4.3. # Here we read the data, add a reordered factor variable, # and continue with making the summary table used in the plot. data(coweeta) coweeta_table &lt;- coweeta %&gt;% mutate(species = reorder(species, height, mean, na.rm=TRUE)) %&gt;% group_by(species) %&gt;% dplyr::summarize(height_mean = mean(height, na.rm=TRUE), height_sd = sd(height, na.rm=TRUE)) ggplot(coweeta_table, aes(x = species, y = height_mean)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, fill=&quot;red&quot;) + geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = height_mean - height_sd, ymax = height_mean + height_sd), width=0.2) + labs(y = &quot;Height (m)&quot;, x = &quot;Species&quot;) Figure 4.3: An ordered barplot for the coweeta tree data (error bars are 1 SD). The above example uses the more modern approach with ggplot2 and dplyr, but we can get practically the same result with doBy and gplots - below is the code for comparison (output not shown). library(doBy) coweeta$species &lt;- with(coweeta, reorder(species, height, mean, na.rm=TRUE)) coweeta_agg &lt;- summaryBy(height ~ species, data=coweeta, FUN=c(mean,sd)) # For barplot2, which adds options for error bars library(gplots) # This par setting makes the x-axis labels vertical, so they don&#39;t overlap. par(las=2) with(coweeta_agg, barplot2(height.mean, names.arg=species, space=0.3, col=&quot;red&quot;,plot.grid=TRUE, ylab=&quot;Height (m)&quot;, plot.ci=TRUE, ci.l=height.mean - height.sd, ci.u=height.mean + height.sd)) The above example orders the factor levels by increasing median sodium levels. Try reversing the factor levels, using the following code after reorder. coweeta$species &lt;- factor(coweeta$species, levels=rev(levels(coweeta$species))) Here we used rev to reverse the levels. 4.2 Combining dataframes 4.2.1 Merging dataframes If we have the following dataset called plantdat, and we have another dataset, that includes the same PlantID variable (but is not necessarily ordered, nor does it have to include values for every plant): and execute the command merge(plantdat, leafnitrogendata, by=&quot;PlantID&quot;) we get the result Note the missing value (NA) for the plant for which no leaf nitrogen data was available. In many problems, you do not have a single dataset that contains all the measurements you are interested in – unlike most of the example datasets in this tutorial. Suppose you have two datasets that you would like to combine, or merge. This is straightforward in R, but there are some pitfalls. Let’s start with a common situation when you need to combine two datasets that have a different number of rows. # Two dataframes data1 &lt;- data.frame(unit=c(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;x&quot;,&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;,&quot;z&quot;),Time=c(1,2,3,1,1,2)) data2 &lt;- data.frame(unit=c(&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;,&quot;x&quot;), height=c(3.4,5.6,1.2)) # Look at the dataframes data1 ## unit Time ## 1 x 1 ## 2 x 2 ## 3 x 3 ## 4 y 1 ## 5 z 1 ## 6 z 2 data2 ## unit height ## 1 y 3.4 ## 2 z 5.6 ## 3 x 1.2 # Merge dataframes: combdata &lt;- merge(data1, data2, by=&quot;unit&quot;) # Combined data combdata ## unit Time height ## 1 x 1 1.2 ## 2 x 2 1.2 ## 3 x 3 1.2 ## 4 y 1 3.4 ## 5 z 1 5.6 ## 6 z 2 5.6 Sometimes, the variable you are merging with has a different name in either dataframe. In that case, you can either rename the variable before merging, or use the following option: merge(data1, data2, by.x=&quot;unit&quot;, by.y=&quot;item&quot;) Where data1 has a variable called ‘unit’, and data2 has a variable called ‘item’. Other times you need to merge two dataframes with multiple key variables. Consider this example, where two dataframes have measurements on the same units at some of the the same times, but on different variables: # Two dataframes data1 &lt;- data.frame(unit=c(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;x&quot;,&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;,&quot;z&quot;,&quot;z&quot;), Time=c(1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3), Weight=c(3.1,5.2,6.9,2.2,5.1,7.5,3.5,6.1,8.0)) data2 &lt;- data.frame(unit=c(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;,&quot;z&quot;), Time=c(1,2,2,3,1,3), Height=c(12.1,24.4,18.0,30.8,10.4,32.9)) # Look at the dataframes data1 ## unit Time Weight ## 1 x 1 3.1 ## 2 x 2 5.2 ## 3 x 3 6.9 ## 4 y 1 2.2 ## 5 y 2 5.1 ## 6 y 3 7.5 ## 7 z 1 3.5 ## 8 z 2 6.1 ## 9 z 3 8.0 data2 ## unit Time Height ## 1 x 1 12.1 ## 2 x 2 24.4 ## 3 y 2 18.0 ## 4 y 3 30.8 ## 5 z 1 10.4 ## 6 z 3 32.9 # Merge dataframes: combdata &lt;- merge(data1, data2, by=c(&quot;unit&quot;,&quot;Time&quot;)) # By default, only those times appear in the dataset that have measurements # for both Weight (data1) and Height (data2) combdata ## unit Time Weight Height ## 1 x 1 3.1 12.1 ## 2 x 2 5.2 24.4 ## 3 y 2 5.1 18.0 ## 4 y 3 7.5 30.8 ## 5 z 1 3.5 10.4 ## 6 z 3 8.0 32.9 # To include all data, use this command. This produces missing values for some times: merge(data1, data2, by=c(&quot;unit&quot;,&quot;Time&quot;), all=TRUE) ## unit Time Weight Height ## 1 x 1 3.1 12.1 ## 2 x 2 5.2 24.4 ## 3 x 3 6.9 NA ## 4 y 1 2.2 NA ## 5 y 2 5.1 18.0 ## 6 y 3 7.5 30.8 ## 7 z 1 3.5 10.4 ## 8 z 2 6.1 NA ## 9 z 3 8.0 32.9 # Compare this result with &#39;combdata&#39; above! 4.2.2 Using join from dplyr We showed how to use the merge function above, which is provided by base R. For larger datasets, it is advisable to use the join* functions from dplyr. Instead of specifying which rows to keep with arguments all.x, all, etc., dplyr provides several functions that should make some intuitive sense. The table below compares merge and join*. merge() dplyr::join* merge(dat1, dat2, all = FALSE) inner_join(dat1, dat2) merge(dat1, dat2, all.x = TRUE) left_join(dat1, dat2) merge(dat1, dat2, all.y = TRUE) right_join(dat1, dat2) merge(dat1, dat2, all = TRUE) full_join(dat1, dat2) One other function is provided that has no simple equivalent in base R, anti_join, which can be used to find all observations that have no match between the two datasets. This can be handy for error-checking. Consider the cereal dataset, which gives measurements of all sorts of contents of cereals. Suppose the measurements for ‘protein’, ‘vitamins’ and ‘sugars’ were all produced by different laboratories, and each lab sent you a separate dataset. To make things worse, some measurements for sugars and vitamins are missing, because samples were lost in those labs. # Read the three datasets given to you from the three different labs: data(cereal1) data(cereal2) data(cereal3) # As always, look at the first few rows of each dataset. head(cereal1, 3) ## Cereal.name protein ## 1 Frosted_Flakes 1 ## 2 Product_19 3 ## 3 Count_Chocula 1 head(cereal2, 3) ## cerealbrand vitamins ## 1 Product_19 100 ## 2 Count_Chocula 25 ## 3 Wheat_Chex 25 head(cereal3, 3) ## cerealname sugars ## 1 Frosted_Flakes 11 ## 2 Product_19 3 ## 3 Mueslix_Crispy_Blend 13 # The name of the variable that ties the datasets together, # the &#39;cereal name&#39; differs between the datasets, as do the number of rows. # We can use merge() three times, but the data are easiest to merge with dplyr: library(dplyr) cereal_combined &lt;- full_join(cereal1, cereal2, by=c(&quot;Cereal.name&quot; = &quot;cerealbrand&quot;)) %&gt;% full_join(cereal3, by=c(&quot;Cereal.name&quot; = &quot;cerealname&quot;)) cereal_combined ## Cereal.name protein vitamins sugars ## 1 Frosted_Flakes 1 NA 11 ## 2 Product_19 3 100 3 ## 3 Count_Chocula 1 25 NA ## 4 Wheat_Chex 3 25 NA ## 5 Honey-comb 1 25 NA ## 6 Shredded_Wheat_spoon_size 3 0 NA ## 7 Mueslix_Crispy_Blend 3 25 13 ## 8 Grape_Nuts_Flakes 3 25 5 ## 9 Strawberry_Fruit_Wheats 2 NA 5 ## 10 Cheerios 6 25 1 # Note that missing values (NA) have been inserted where some data were not available. 4.2.3 Row-binding dataframes If we have the following dataset called plantdat, and we have another dataset (plantdatmore), with exactly the same columns (including the names and order of the columns), and execute the command rbind(plantdat, plantdatmore) we get the result Using merge, we were able to glue dataframes together side-by-side based on one or more ‘index’ variables. Sometimes you have multiple datasets that can be glued together top-to-bottom, for example when you have multiple very similar dataframes. We can use the rbind function, like so: # Some fake data mydata1 &lt;- data.frame(var1=1:3, var2=5:7) mydata2 &lt;- data.frame(var1=4:6, var2=8:10) # The dataframes have the same column names, in the same order: mydata1 ## var1 var2 ## 1 1 5 ## 2 2 6 ## 3 3 7 mydata2 ## var1 var2 ## 1 4 8 ## 2 5 9 ## 3 6 10 # So we can use rbind to row-bind them together: rbind(mydata1, mydata2) ## var1 var2 ## 1 1 5 ## 2 2 6 ## 3 3 7 ## 4 4 8 ## 5 5 9 ## 6 6 10 Let’s look at the above rbind example again but with a modification where some observations are duplicated between dataframes. This might happen, for example, when working with files containing time-series data and where there is some overlap between the two datasets. The union function from the dplyr package only returns unique observations: # Some fake data mydata1 &lt;- data.frame(var1=1:3, var2=5:7) mydata2 &lt;- data.frame(var1=2:4, var2=6:8) # The dataframes have the same column names, in the same order: mydata1 ## var1 var2 ## 1 1 5 ## 2 2 6 ## 3 3 7 mydata2 ## var1 var2 ## 1 2 6 ## 2 3 7 ## 3 4 8 # &#39;rbind&#39; leads to duplicate observations, &#39;union&#39; removes these: dplyr::union(mydata1, mydata2) ## var1 var2 ## 1 1 5 ## 2 2 6 ## 3 3 7 ## 4 4 8 rbind(mydata1, mydata2) ## var1 var2 ## 1 1 5 ## 2 2 6 ## 3 3 7 ## 4 2 6 ## 5 3 7 ## 6 4 8 Sometimes, you want to rbind dataframes together but the column names do not exactly match. One option is to first process the dataframes so that they do match (using subscripting). Or, just use the bind_rows function from dplyr. Look at this example where we have two dataframes that have only one column in common, but we want to keep all the columns (and fill with NA where necessary), # Some fake data mydata1 &lt;- data.frame(index=c(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;C&quot;), var1=5:7) mydata2 &lt;- data.frame(var1=8:10, species=c(&quot;one&quot;,&quot;two&quot;,&quot;three&quot;)) # smartbind the dataframes together dplyr::bind_rows(mydata1, mydata2) ## index var1 species ## 1 A 5 &lt;NA&gt; ## 2 B 6 &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 C 7 &lt;NA&gt; ## 4 &lt;NA&gt; 8 one ## 5 &lt;NA&gt; 9 two ## 6 &lt;NA&gt; 10 three Note: an equivalent function to bind dataframes side-by-side is cbind, which can be used instead of merge when no index variables are present. However, in this book, the use of cbind is discouraged for dataframes as it can lead to problems that are difficult to fix, and in all practical applications a merge is preferable. 4.3 Reshaping data 4.3.1 From wide to long In the majority of analyses in R, we like to have our data in ‘long’ format (nowadays sometimes called the ‘tidy’ format), where the data for some kind of measurement are in one column, and we have one or more factor variables distinguishing groups like individual, date, treatment, and so on. It is however common encounter data in ‘wide format’, which can be converted to long format by reshaping appropriately. The first example uses the dutch election data. data(dutchelection) head(dutchelection,3) ## Date VVD PvdA PVV CDA SP D66 GL CU SGP PvdD FiftyPlus ## 1 2012-03-22 22.1 16.8 13.9 9.4 16.8 7.7 4.5 3.3 1.5 2.4 1.1 ## 2 2012-04-05 23.6 17.1 13.3 8.8 16.3 8.7 4.1 3.2 1.4 2.0 0.8 ## 3 2012-04-19 24.0 17.3 12.0 8.2 17.0 8.8 3.5 3.3 1.6 3.1 0.8 The data include percentage votes for 11 Dutch political parties in a 2012 election, and somewhat intuitively the parties have been ordered as columns (so that each row adds up to ca. 100%, ignoring some tiny parties). For purposes of analysis, we would like to reshape this dataset to long format, so that we have just columns ‘Date’, ‘Party’, and ‘Poll’. Right now ‘Party’ is in the column names, and ‘Poll’ represents the polling numbers; the actual data in the cells. As is often the case, there are many ways to solve this. For most basic reshaping tasks we recommend the tidyr package, however some other methods may be needed for more complex tasks, as we find in further examples below. library(tidyr) # The new dataframe will have a column &#39;Party&#39; with current columns, # *except* Date (hence the -Date), # and values will be stored in &#39;Poll&#39; elect_long &lt;- gather(dutchelection, Party, Poll, -Date) head(elect_long,3) ## Date Party Poll ## 1 2012-03-22 VVD 22.1 ## 2 2012-04-05 VVD 23.6 ## 3 2012-04-19 VVD 24.0 # Identical results can be had with melt() from reshape2, # a function which otherwise includes more options. # See `?melt.data.frame` for more options (not `?melt`, # which is the generic function). library(reshape2) elect_long &lt;- melt(dutchelection, variable.name=&quot;Party&quot;, value.name=&quot;Poll&quot;, id.vars=&quot;Date&quot;) The advantage of melt is that we can include more than one ID variables, like in the following example. This example also shows the common need for some text processing after reshaping. In this simple dataset, length of feet and hands was measured on two persons on three consecutive days. We want to reshape it to end up with columns ‘Day’, ‘Person’, ‘Length’ and ‘BodyPart’ (feet or hands). dat &lt;- data.frame(Day=rep(1:3, each=2), Person=rep(letters[1:2], 3), Length.feet = rep(c(2,3), 3), Length.hands=rep(c(3,4),3)) dat ## Day Person Length.feet Length.hands ## 1 1 a 2 3 ## 2 1 b 3 4 ## 3 2 a 2 3 ## 4 2 b 3 4 ## 5 3 a 2 3 ## 6 3 b 3 4 # Now reshape to long format, using melt.data.frame dat_long &lt;- melt(dat, id.vars=c(&quot;Day&quot;,&quot;Person&quot;), value.name=&quot;Length&quot;, variable.name=&quot;BodyPart&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(BodyPart = gsub(&quot;Length.&quot;, &quot;&quot;, BodyPart)) dat_long ## Day Person BodyPart Length ## 1 1 a feet 2 ## 2 1 b feet 3 ## 3 2 a feet 2 ## 4 2 b feet 3 ## 5 3 a feet 2 ## 6 3 b feet 3 ## 7 1 a hands 3 ## 8 1 b hands 4 ## 9 2 a hands 3 ## 10 2 b hands 4 ## 11 3 a hands 3 ## 12 3 b hands 4 4.3.2 From long to wide Occasionally we like to use wide format, where groups of data are placed next to each other instead of on top of each other. For the first example consider this simple dataset with a set of questions asked to two persons, survey &lt;- read.table(text=&quot;user question answer a question_1 hi a question_2 hey a question_3 oh a question_4 no a question_5 yes a question_6 obv b question_1 cool b question_2 good b question_3 yes b question_4 sweet b question_5 wow b question_6 no&quot;, header=TRUE) survey ## user question answer ## 1 a question_1 hi ## 2 a question_2 hey ## 3 a question_3 oh ## 4 a question_4 no ## 5 a question_5 yes ## 6 a question_6 obv ## 7 b question_1 cool ## 8 b question_2 good ## 9 b question_3 yes ## 10 b question_4 sweet ## 11 b question_5 wow ## 12 b question_6 no In this case we actually want to have all data for each ‘user’ in a single row, thus creating columns ‘question_1’, ‘question_2’ and so on. The first solution uses spread from tidyr. library(tidyr) spread(survey, question, answer) ## user question_1 question_2 question_3 question_4 question_5 question_6 ## 1 a hi hey oh no yes obv ## 2 b cool good yes sweet wow no The second solution uses dcast from reshape2. I show this solution because unlike spread, dcast can be used for more complicated reshaping problems. library(reshape2) dcast(survey, user ~ question, value.var=&quot;answer&quot;) ## user question_1 question_2 question_3 question_4 question_5 question_6 ## 1 a hi hey oh no yes obv ## 2 b cool good yes sweet wow no Here, the formula indicates ‘user goes in rows, question in columns’, and value.var is the name of the variable used to populate the cells. For the second, more complex, example we use a small version of the eucface_gasexchange dataset, which includes measurements of photosynthesis (Photo) on two experimental plots (Plot) on three Dates (Date), under two experimental treatments (treatment). Clearly we have multiple levels of nesting of our data, and each of these nesting levels is represented by a different variable. gas &lt;- read.table(text=&quot;Date Plot treatment Photo A 1 Amb 14.4 A 1 Ele 16.3 A 2 Amb 17.8 A 2 Ele 13.3 B 1 Amb 16.4 B 1 Ele 19 B 2 Amb 15 B 2 Ele 10.8 C 1 Amb 17.5 C 1 Ele 19.8 C 2 Amb 13.5 C 2 Ele 12.1 &quot;, header=TRUE) Now we have two variables that describe which measurements ‘belong together’ (experimental plot, and treatment). We can no longer use spread (which uses just one of those variables), but dcast does work nicely with multiple groupings: dcast(gas, Date + Plot ~ treatment, value.var=&quot;Photo&quot;) ## Date Plot Amb Ele ## 1 A 1 14.4 16.3 ## 2 A 2 17.8 13.3 ## 3 B 1 16.4 19.0 ## 4 B 2 15.0 10.8 ## 5 C 1 17.5 19.8 ## 6 C 2 13.5 12.1 We have another possibility here, to instead place the values for the individual plots and treatments next to each other. Note we now move Plot to the right-hand side of the formula in dcast. dcast(gas, Date ~ Plot + treatment, value.var=&quot;Photo&quot;) ## Date 1_Amb 1_Ele 2_Amb 2_Ele ## 1 A 14.4 16.3 17.8 13.3 ## 2 B 16.4 19.0 15.0 10.8 ## 3 C 17.5 19.8 13.5 12.1 4.4 More complex dplyr examples In this chapter, we have learned many new tools to work with data - filtering, summarizing, reshaping, and so on. One advantage of the dplyr package over functions in base R is that the various operations can be efficiently combined with the %&gt;% operator, combining all your data converting and shaping steps into one. This will become clear with some examples. 4.4.1 Tree growth data: filter and multiple groupings The first example uses the hfeifbytree data from the lgrdata package. This dataset contains measurements of height and stem diameter on nearly 1200 Eucalyptus trees in Sydney, repeated 17 times. The trees grow in plots subjected to different treatments (control, fertilization, irrigation, or both). On some of the dates, all trees were measured, while on other dates a small subsample was taken (ca. 10% of all trees). We want to make a plot of average tree height by treatment over time, but use only the dates were all trees were measured. The following code makes Fig. 4.4. data(hfeifbytree) library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) library(ggthemes) hfeif_meanh &lt;- mutate(hfeifbytree, Date = as.Date(Date)) %&gt;% # Convert to proper Date group_by(Date) %&gt;% # Set up the grouping variable filter(n() &gt; 500) %&gt;% # Keep groups with more than 500 observations group_by(Date, treat) %&gt;% # New grouping; to get average by Date and treatment summarize(height = mean(height, na.rm=TRUE)) %&gt;% # Average height, discard NA. rename(treatment = treat) # rename a variable # It is possible to make the plot inside the data pipeline, but # we recommend separating them! ggplot(hfeif_meanh, aes(x = Date, y = height, col = treatment)) + geom_point(size = 2) + geom_line() + scale_colour_tableau() + ylim(c(0,20)) Figure 4.4: Average tree height by treatment over time, for the hfeifbytree data 4.4.2 Crude oil production: find top exporters In the second example we will use the oil data, a dataset with annual crude oil production for the top 8 oil-producing countries since 1971. We want to find the top three countries for the period 1980-1985, sort them, and replace the country abbreviations with country names. data(oil) # First we make a dataframe with the abbreviations. # Very handy here is tribble from tibble; making it easier to write # small dataframes directly into your script. library(tibble) abb_key &lt;- tribble(~country, ~country_full, &quot;MEX&quot;, &quot;Mexico&quot;, &quot;USA&quot;, &quot;USA&quot;, &quot;CHN&quot;, &quot;China&quot;, &quot;IRN&quot;, &quot;Iran&quot;, &quot;SAU&quot;, &quot;Saudi-Arabia&quot;, &quot;IRQ&quot;, &quot;Iraq&quot;, &quot;KWT&quot;, &quot;Kuwait&quot;, &quot;VEN&quot;, &quot;Venezuela&quot;) # To avoid a warning, we first convert country to character # (not strictly necessary) oil_top &lt;- mutate(oil, country = as.character(country), production_M = production / 1000) %&gt;% # Convert to million tonnes. full_join(abb_key, by=&quot;country&quot;) %&gt;% # Add full country name filter(year %in% 1980:1985) %&gt;% # Subset for years between 1980-1985 group_by(country_full) %&gt;% summarize(production_M = mean(production_M)) %&gt;% arrange(desc(production_M)) %&gt;% # Sort by production; in descending order as.data.frame %&gt;% # To be consistent, output a dataframe head(., 3) # Only show the top 32 # Finally make a table that looks nice in an rmarkdown document library(pander) oil_top %&gt;% pander(., caption = &quot;Top three oil producing countries, 1980-1985.&quot;, col.names = c(&quot;Country&quot;, &quot;Annual production (MTOE)&quot;)) Top three oil producing countries, 1980-1985. Country Annual production (MTOE) USA 443.5 Saudi-Arabia 335.1 Mexico 138.8 Run the example above, and modify the code so that we find the maximum oil production for each country, and the table should show the 2 countries with the lowest maximum. 4.4.3 Weight loss data: make an irregular timeseries regular In this example we will use the weightloss data, again from the lgrdata package. A person recorded his weight on irregular intervals (1-3 days), to check if his diet was having the desired effect. Because the dataset is irregular, it is not easy to calculate daily weight loss for the entire dataset. We can use a combination of dplyr, zoo and padr to clean up this dataset. The pad function is quite powerful: it takes a dataframe, figures the time-indexing variable (in our case, Date), and stretches the dataset to include all Dates along the dataset, filling NA where no data were available. The zoo package contains many useful functions for timeseries data. Here we use na.approx to linearly interpolate missing values. We also make a plot of the weight loss data, clarifying which data were interpolated. The following code make Fig. 4.5. library(lubridate) library(dplyr) library(zoo) library(padr) data(weightloss) weightloss2 &lt;- mutate(weightloss, Date = dmy(Date), # proper Date class Weight = Weight * 0.4536) %&gt;% # convert to kg pad(interval =&quot;day&quot;) %&gt;% # timeseries is now regular mutate(measured = !is.na(Weight), # FALSE when the value was interpolated Weight = na.approx(Weight)) # linear interpolation (zoo) ggplot(weightloss2, aes(x = Date, y = Weight)) + geom_point(colour = ifelse(weightloss2$measured, &quot;darkgrey&quot;, &quot;red2&quot;)) Figure 4.5: The weightloss data, with linearly interpolated missing values (red). 4.5 Exercises 4.5.1 Summarizing the cereal data Read the cereal data, and produce quick summaries using str, summary, contents and describe (recall that the last two are in the Hmisc package). Interpret the results. Find the average sodium, fiber and carbohydrate contents by Manufacturer. Use either summaryBy or dplyr. Add a new variable ‘SodiumClass’, which is ‘high’ when sodium &gt; 150 and ‘low’ otherwise. Make sure the new variable is a factor. Look at the examples in Section 3.7.1 to recall how to do this. Now, find the average, minimum and maximum sugar content for ‘low’ and ‘high’ sodium. Hint: make sure to use na.rm=TRUE, because the dataset contains missing values. Find the maximum sugar content by Manufacturer and sodiumClass, using tapply. Inspect the result and notice there are missing values. Try to use na.rm=TRUE as an additional argument to tapply, only to find out that the values are still missing. Finally, use xtabs (see Section 4.1.2, p. 4.1.2) to count the number of observations by the two factors to find out if we have missing values in the tapply result. Repeat the previous question with summaryBy or dplyr. Compare the results. Count the number of observations by Manufacturer and whether the cereal is ‘hot’ or ‘cold’, using xtabs (see Section 4.1.2). } 4.5.2 Words and the weather Using the ‘Age and memory’ dataset (memory from the lgrdata package), find the mean and maximum number of words recalled by ‘Older’ and ‘Younger’ age classes. The hfemet2008 dataset contains meteorological measurements at a station near Sydney, Australia. Find the mean air temperature by month. To do this, first add the month variable as shown in Section 3.7.5.3. 4.5.3 Merging data Load the pupae dataset. The data contain measurements of larva (‘pupae’) weight and ‘frass’ (excrement) production while allowed to feed on leaves, grown under different concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2). Also read this short dataset, which gives a label ‘roomnumber’ for each CO\\(_2\\) treatment. To read this dataset, consider the data.frame function described in Section 3.4.1. Merge the short dataset onto the pupae data. Check the result. 4.5.4 Merging multiple datasets Read Section 4.2.2, and learn how to merge more than two datasets together. First, run the following code to construct three dataframes that we will attempt to merge together. dataset1 &lt;- data.frame(unit=letters[1:9], treatment=rep(LETTERS[1:3],each=3), Damage=runif(9,50,100)) unitweight &lt;- data.frame(unit=letters[c(1,2,4,6,8,9)], Weight = rnorm(6,100,0.3)) treatlocation &lt;- data.frame(treatment=LETTERS[1:3], Glasshouse=c(&quot;G1&quot;,&quot;G2&quot;,&quot;G3&quot;)) Merge the three datasets together, to end up with one dataframe that has the columns ‘unit’, ‘treatment’, ‘Glasshouse’, ‘Damage’ and ‘Weight’. Some units do not have measurements of Weight. Merge the datasets in two ways to either include or exclude the units without Weight measurements. To do this, either use merge or dplyr::join twice - you cannot merge more than two datasets in one step. } 4.5.5 Ordered boxplot First read the cereals data and learn how to make a boxplot, using R base graphics: Notice the ordering of the boxes from left to right, and compare it to levels of the factor variable Manufacturer. Now, redraw the plot with Manufacturer in order of increasing mean sodium content (use reorder, see Section 4.1.4). Inspect the help page (?boxplot), and change the boxplots so that the width varies with the number of observations per manufacturer (Hint: find the varwidth argument). "],
["reporting.html", "Chapter 5 Visualizing data and making reports 5.1 Introduction 5.2 Visualizing data 5.3 ggplot2 5.4 Making reports", " Chapter 5 Visualizing data and making reports 5.1 Introduction Data visualization is an integral part of any data analytical project. We use data viz to spot patterns in data, check model assumptions, communicate findings, and to convince the audience that our analysis and conclusions make sense. Data viz is not something you only do at the end, but we cycle between analysis and visualization. It is therefore not only an important skill to make beautiful visualizations in the final communication of your results, but also to be able to make quick &amp; dirty graphs at any step in the analysis. We do not only use visualizations, but also like to combine text, tables, figures, images, and well-formatted text in reports. We now have a powerful tool available in R, the rmarkdown document - a flexible toolkit to generate documents containing all results from R (with or without the code). These reports ensure that the results you see are made from the code in the document, we never have to ask: which version of my code produced those results? We already used rmarkdown in Chapter 2, but go a few steps further here and provide useful tips &amp; tricks. This chapter is different from the rest: we do not provide a complete beginners guide to either data visualization with ggplot2, or reporting with rmarkdown. We point to online resources for getting started, including comprehensive manuals, and galleries of examples. Instead, we focus on pointing out typical difficulties when getting started with these tools, and give some handy tips that may go unnoticed. For data visualization, also be aware that the entire book in front of you includes many figures produced with ggplot2 or base graphics - we encourage you to study the examples. As always, learning from example is the easiest. 5.2 Visualizing data 5.2.1 Base graphics or ggplot2? R comes with two graphics systems, that cannot be used together. The base graphics system has been part of R from the start, and continues to be used today. The second system is the grid system, and the most popular package that uses this system is ggplot2, a package in development for over 10 years that now sees very wide application, and numerous add-ons and extensions. Personally, I have used base graphics since 2001, and resisted switching to ggplot2 for a very long time. I now use ggplot2 for visualizing data, but continue to use base graphics as well, for a few reasons - especially because many add-on packaged include some quick plotting function that returns a base plot. You can read around the web for many opinionated accounts on why we should use ggplot2 or the other (for example here). A few points to consider: Use ggplot2 if you are a newcomer, because it is easier to make more complex graphs. For example, it is much easier to make multi-panel, multi-line, multi-everything figures than with base graphics. Notable examples include multi-panel figures with grouped bar plots, adding regression and smoothed lines with confidence bands to plots, overlapping area plots, histograms and ribbons. All of these plots are possible with base, but usually require more code and more programming. It is generally easier to achieve consistent figure formatting with ggplot2, through the use of themes. Many packages include some built-in plotting function, more often than not these use base graphics. It is usually much easier to use those functions directly than to implement the figure from scratch in ggplot2. A basic understanding of base graphics is therefore useful in practice. Sometimes, base graphics are easier, especially when you are experimenting and want to make quick and dirty plots. To plot a mathematical function, we can do curve(x^3, from=-1, to=1) - this is not so easy in ggplot2. There is no support for 3D graphics in ggplot2, but base has a number of possibilities. That said, you probably do not want to make many 3D plots. Use base graphics when you are making a simple plot, and wish to avoid dependencies. Keeping dependencies to a minimum will make it more likely your code works in the future, and on someone else’s machine. The ggplot2 package is rather stable these days, but has changed dramatically in the past - often breaking old code. For the reasons mentioned above, in this book we mostly use ggplot2, except when base graphics are a lot easier (that is, use less code). 5.2.2 Base graphics In base graphics, we can choose from the following main plotting functions (this list is not complete, especially if you consider add-on packages): Function Key functions plot Scatter plots, line plots, various others. barplot Bar plot (including stacked and grouped bar plots) hist Histograms and (relative) frequency diagrams curve Curves of mathematical expressions pie Pie charts (for less scientific uses) boxplot Box-and-whisker plots symbols Like scatter plot, but symbols are sized by another variable Here it is useful to know that plot is a so-called generic function, which has methods for many special objects in R. For example, if we fit a linear regression: lmfit &lt;- lm(disp ~ hp, data = mtcars) We can use the very brief command plot(lmfit) to produce four diagnostic plots. This works because a function called plot.lm is actually used when you send an lm object to the plot function (thus we can look at useful options in this case in the help page ?plot.lm). Similarly, plot will make different plots based on what type of data you use. In Fig. 5.1 four examples are shown; each of these is the result from a call to plot(), but with different data types. Figure 5.1: Four possible outcomes of a basic call to plot(), depending on whether the Y and X variables are numeric or factor variables. The term ‘numeric dataframe’ means a dataframe where all columns are numeric. The way that plot gives different results depending on data types is both a good thing (for basic plots, you need very little code), and a bad thing because reading the code often does not tell you what sort of plot will be produced, and where to read the documentation (?plot, ?plot.default, ?plot.factor?). 5.2.3 Histograms One reason I still use base graphics is the quickest way to draw a histogram (frequency or density diagram). We often use these during analyses, to get an idea of the kind data contained in a vector. data(vessel) # Some formatting first. par() is a powerful yet difficult to learn function. # If you leave out &#39;breaks&#39;, the breaks are automatically calculated. # A setting worth experimenting with though!! par(mar=c(5,5,2,2), cex.lab=1.1) hist(vessel$vesseldiam, main = &quot;&quot;, breaks=50, col=&quot;darkgoldenrod3&quot;, xlab=&quot;Tree vessel diameter (micrometer)&quot;) box() Figure 5.2: A simple histogram of the vessel dataset. Make the plot above, inspect the data to find out why there are two peaks. Now make two histograms, each with one peak, based on subsets of the data. 5.2.4 Resources One standout resource with examples and explanations is here: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/r-base-graphs. 5.3 ggplot2 The ggplot2 package is an incredibly rich and powerful toolkit to construct plots. It is far beyond the scope of this book to provide a complete overview of the package, but luckily lots of free online resources are available (see Section 5.3.5). We will show the functionality of ggplot2 by providing two examples, one scatterplot, and one barplot. Since we use ggplot2 throughout this book, you can find many more examples. The following three examples were chosen because they highlight a few key options. 5.3.1 Preparing the data for plotting To use ggplot2, our data have to always be in long format, where each row represents an observation, and each column in the dataframe represents a type of measurement. Most of the datasets included in the lgrdata package are already in long format. One exception is the dutchelection dataset: data(dutchelection) head(dutchelection, 3) ## Date VVD PvdA PVV CDA SP D66 GL CU SGP PvdD FiftyPlus ## 1 2012-03-22 22.1 16.8 13.9 9.4 16.8 7.7 4.5 3.3 1.5 2.4 1.1 ## 2 2012-04-05 23.6 17.1 13.3 8.8 16.3 8.7 4.1 3.2 1.4 2.0 0.8 ## 3 2012-04-19 24.0 17.3 12.0 8.2 17.0 8.8 3.5 3.3 1.6 3.1 0.8 We cannot really use ggplot2 when the data are formatted like this. Instead we want to have a dataframe with columns ‘Date’, ‘party’, and ‘vote_percent’, so that we can label the graph by political party. As we saw in Section 4.3, quite magically we can use melt from reshape2 : library(reshape2) dutchlong &lt;- melt(dutchelection, variable.name = &quot;party&quot;, value.name=&quot;vote_percent&quot;) head(dutchlong, 3) ## Date party vote_percent ## 1 2012-03-22 VVD 22.1 ## 2 2012-04-05 VVD 23.6 ## 3 2012-04-19 VVD 24.0 5.3.2 Scatterplot example Here we show two examples of a scatter plot. In practice you start with the simplest plot you can think of, then gradually add ‘layers’ and other elements. Here, the quickest way to make a scatter plot is like this, # Minimal data(automobiles) ggplot(automobiles, aes(x = horsepower, y = fuel_efficiency)) + geom_point() ## Warning: Removed 6 rows containing missing values (geom_point). Explanation: The first argument to ggplot is a dataframe (automobiles) The aes function defines the “aesthetics”, here x for X-axis, and y for Y-axis. ggplot doesn’t really plot anything yet, just gets things ready. Layers are added with +. Here, a single layer with points. Next, we want to extend this example by including various other elements: Plotting symbols colored by Region. A linear regression line, one for each of the three Regions. Text labels identifying outliers. A legend. Better axis labels. Study the example below how each of these was included: # Extended data(automobiles) library(ggrepel) library(dplyr) library(ggthemes) automobiles2 &lt;- mutate(automobiles, resid = residuals(lm(fuel_efficiency ~ horsepower, na.action=na.exclude))) ggplot(automobiles2, aes(x = horsepower, y = fuel_efficiency, col = origin, label = car_name)) + geom_point(pch = ifelse(abs(automobiles2$resid) &gt; 6, 19, 1)) + geom_text_repel(data = subset(automobiles2, abs(resid) &gt; 6), show.legend=FALSE) + lims(x = c(0,300), y = c(0,40)) + stat_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) + scale_colour_tableau() + labs(x = &quot;Horse power (hp)&quot;, y = &quot;Fuel use (liters / 100km)&quot;) 5.3.3 Area plot example A ‘stacked area chart’ can be quickly implemented with the geom_area function, like the next example. Note how we use another aesthetic, fill, to set the colour of the filled areas by country. data(oil) ggplot(oil, aes(x=year, y=production/1000, fill=country)) + geom_area() + labs(x = &quot;&quot;, y = &quot;Crude Oil Production (MOE)&quot;) + scale_fill_economist() 5.3.4 Barplot example More complex barplots is one area where ggplot2 is much, much easier to use than base graphics. If you want to represent count data as bars - a common application of barplots - ggplot2 does the counting for you automatically, saving a step where such tables of counts have to be constructed. If instead you want to make a barplot of data as they are (that is, don’t make tables first), use the setting geom_bar(stat = \"identity\"), instead of stat = \"count\", as in the example below. In the following example we use the titanic data, available in the lgrdata package. library(lgrdata) data(titanic) # Important to convert factor variables to factors! # &#39;Survived&#39; is coded as 0,1 - but this is really a factor. titanic$Survived &lt;- as.factor(titanic$Survived) library(ggplot2) library(ggthemes) The following code is the minimal code needed to make a barplot with two panels (one for female passengers, one for male), counting passengers that have survived or died, for each of the three passenger classes. # Result not shown - see next example ggplot(titanic, aes(x=PClass, fill=Survived)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;count&quot;, position=position_dodge()) + facet_wrap(~Sex) You can run the code above yourself to see what is produced. It does not look great, so instead we re-format the legend, the colors, etc., and end up with Fig. ??. For both of these figures, make sure that Survived is a factor variable, otherwise the plot won’t look right. ggplot(titanic, aes(x=PClass, fill=Survived)) + # bars by passenger class, # split by &#39;Survived&#39; scale_fill_manual(labels=c(&quot;Died&quot;, &quot;Survived&quot;), # labels for legend values=c(&quot;red2&quot;,&quot;grey&quot;)) + # colors for bars (and legend) geom_bar(stat=&quot;count&quot;, position=position_dodge()) + # count data, bars side by side facet_wrap(~Sex) + # panels by Sex theme(legend.title=element_blank()) # no legend title Same figure but stacked bars, expressed as percent of total (Fig. ??). ggplot(titanic, aes(x=PClass, fill=as.factor(Survived))) + scale_fill_manual(labels=c(&quot;Died&quot;, &quot;Survived&quot;), # labels for legend values=c(&quot;red2&quot;,&quot;grey&quot;)) + # colors for bars (and legend) geom_bar(stat=&quot;count&quot;, position=position_fill()) + # count the data, stack the bars scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent) + # express y-axis as % facet_wrap(~Sex) + # two panels for each sex theme(legend.title=element_blank()) # no legend title 5.3.5 Resources The web is bursting with great ggplot2 tutorials and collections of examples. If you are stuck on some aspect, simply type your question into Google, and you will usually end up at a useful Stackoverflow post. A selection of useful resources is: My favorite resources with lots of small examples: http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/ A very practical gallery guide at http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-essentials Official page with (extensive) documentation: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/ A more gentle introduction to ggplot2 at https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html An attractive gallery of useful plots, with all code at http://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html The ggplot2 package has many extensions, packages that offer additional options, themes, plotting layouts, etc. In this book, we only use a couple of add-on packages for reasons of brevity. These include: ggthemes : an excellent collection of themes and color palettes scales : useful functions for formatting axes, adjusting colors gridExtra : to arrange multiple, separate plots, on one page 5.4 Making reports Script files are good for simple analyses, and they are great for storing small amounts of code that you would like to use in lots of different projects. They are also the right solution if you want to produce R scripts that are executed as part of a larger project, for example from the command line, or executed on a schedule (e.g. daily data quality checking). In Section 2.12.2 we give a few more tips. But, scripts are not the best way to share your results with others. Instead, we strongly suggest you use R markdown - a document format that includes both text with markup, and code chunks, bits of R code that is executed, and the results placed in the document. Markdown is a simple set of rules for formatting text files so that they are both human-readable and processable by software, and is used not just by rmarkdown but in many applications (like Github and Stackoverflow). R Markdown simply adds R, by allowing code chunks with various options. 5.4.1 Getting started RStudio offers a handy editor for markdown files, and starts with an example file that shows many of the features. Start a new markdown file by choosing File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown…. For now, leave the default settings. The new R markdown document (which is just a text file with the extension .Rmd) already contains some example code. Run this example by clicking the button just above the markdown document (Knit HTML). The example code will generate a new document (an HTML page), which opens in your browser You can see that the output contains text, R code, and even a plot. Try ‘knitting’ the example rmarkdown file (the one you see when you open your first rmarkdown file). First install the knitr and rmarkdown packages. Next, click the ‘Knit’ button in the upper-right hand corner just above the file. An HTML file was created. Find it and open it. 5.4.2 Tips Start with an example document When you open a new rmarkdown file (see previous section), the first step is to delete everything in the example document, except the top section and the first code chunk. Your rmarkdown document will now look like this: --- title: &quot;Untitled&quot; output: html_document --- ```{r, include=FALSE} knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) ``` Modify the output style You can add lots of options to the header (the bit between --), that affect how the conversion to HTML works (including style, settings for the table of contents, author, date, etc.). See the Rstudio help page for the HTML version of rmarkdown by following this link. We list a few useful options; to see how these can be used search for them on the link above. code_folding: hide, hides the code in the document, but adds a button to reveal the code. toc_float: true, a very nice floating table of contents (the contents are always visible in a menu to the left) theme: cosmo, or lots of other choices to be picked from this gallery, changes the colors, fonts, and general appearance of the document. Learn markdown syntax for text formatting As mentioned, the rest of the document contains two types of input: text with markup, and code chunks. Open a new rmarkdown document to see what the text with input looks like, and note the use of sections, formatting (bold, italic, etc.), weblinks, and so on. Follow the Rstudio rmarkdown lessons to learn more. Set options for individual code chunks The code chunks contain R code, which will be executed, and the results will be visible in the eventual document (in our case, an HTML page). An R code chunk may look like this, ```{r titanicglm, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE} fit &lt;- glm(Survived ~ Age, data = titanic) ``` Here, titanicglm is a label for the chunk (you don’t need to set it), and echo = TRUE make the code visible in the document, and eval=TRUE actually runs the code in the chunk. Both these options are used a lot. You use echo=FALSE to not show code, for example when there is too much messy code to share for this particular block. You use eval = FALSE to disable execution of a single code chunk. This is very useful when you have some code that simply does not work yet, but you hate using comments (#) to disable it, instead you can place the code in its own chunk and set echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE. Set options for figure output An important step is to control the output of figures. The documentation (see @Section(rmarkdownresources)) is a bit overwhelming, but here is an example with some useful settings: ```{r titanicplot1, fig.cap=&quot;Number of passengers by Sex and PClass&quot;, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, dev=&quot;svg&quot;, echo = -1}`r&#39;&#39;` par(bg=&quot;azure&quot;) with(titanic, spineplot(Sex, PClass)) ``` Here, fig.cap makes a figure caption (but figures will not be automatically numbered, see below for an alternative), fig.width and fig.height set the figure size in inches, dev=\"svg\" sets the graphic device to SVG (an outstanding format for the web) - you need to install svglite for this to work. Finally echo=-1 hides the first row of the code in the output (in this case, we don’t want the reader to be bothered by graphical settings in par()). Set options for all code chunks The section shown above that contains knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) sets chunk options for the entire document. An often used feature here is to hide all code from the eventual document by setting echo=FALSE, or set the figure size for all chunks with fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5, or use a particular graphics device (dev = 'svg'). Auto-numbering of figures and tables In the example above, we set a caption for a figure, but the figures are not automatically numbered in rmarkdown. To enable this, all you have to do is install the bookdown package, and replace the header with this example: --- title: &quot;Untitled&quot; output: bookdown::html_document2 --- Everything else should work as expected, but now figures that contain a fig.cap setting will be automatically numbered! Make R output pretty One thing you notice quickly is that R output that is usually printed to the screen, will look exactly the same in an rmarkdown document - ugly. For example, try this code chunk: summary(titanic) The output in the HTML is not attractive, to say the least. A number of packages will convert raw R output to markdown or HTML output, which can be used effectively in rmarkdown documents. Here we recommend using the pander package to convert many R objects to readable output for use in rmarkdown documents, and the kable function from the knitr package to convert things that look like dataframes. Both packages are very easy to use. library(pander) # for pander() library(knitr) # for kable() library(magrittr) # for %&gt;% summary(titanic) %&gt;% pander summary(titanic) %&gt;% kable Try the pander function on many outputs from statistical analyses as well, for example: test_output &lt;- t.test(Age ~ Sex, data = titanic) pander(test_output) 5.4.3 Resources The documentation for rmarkdown based documents is a little scattered across various sources. The reason for this is that multiple packages are involved in making an HTML page from an .Rmd file. The knitr package handles the execution of the R code in the document, and the integration of the R output into the document. It provides all options that are set at the top of each code chunk, for example to show or hide the code, to control figure size and resolution, captions for tables. All chunk options are listed on the knitr website. The rmarkdown package (from Rstudio) handles the conversion to the desired output format, for example HTML or PDF. To do so, it uses Pandoc (see below), which is installed automatically with Rstudio. The rmarkdown package provides all options at the top of the Rmd document (the so-called YAML header), including the desired output format, and to control many options like the table of contents, format style, custom CSS, and so on. All options for rmarkdown are described on Rstudio’s website. (Make sure to scroll down and select an output format to read about available options). Finally, Pandoc is the actual engine to convert our raw text file (including R output formatted by knitr) to an HTML page, or some other format. Normally you don’t have to learn much about Pandoc’s options, since many settings are already provided by rmarkdown, but the various formatting rules and conversion options are described here.

There are many books focused on statistics, with or without example R code. The focus throughout this book is on the R code itself, as we try to present clear and short solutions to common analysis tasks. In the following, we assume you have a basic understanding of linear regression, Student’s \\(t\\)-tests, ANOVA, and confidence intervals for the mean. Linear modelling is a general technique that includes linear regression, but also basic means testing, comparing samples, and more complex combinations of class and numeric predictors. In linear modelling we are interested in understanding variation in a single numeric response variable (or sometimes binary). We can include all sorts of predictors (‘explanatory variables’, ‘independent variables’), depending on what we chose we end up with various techniques: factor variable(s), test difference in mean in our predictor across the factor (“Analysis of variance”, “t-test”) a single numeric predictor (simple linear regression) multiple numeric predictors, and interactions (multiple linear regression) mixture of factors and numeric predictors (in the simplest case, analysis of covariance - ANCOVA) There are many more complicated possibilities, but the above is what this chapter is all about. Packages used in this chapter The examples will generally let you know which packages are used, but for your convenience, here is a complete list of the packages used. For plotting, we often use ggplot2, ggthemes, scales and ggpubr (these are frequently omitted from the examples): Otherwise: lgrdata (for the example datasets) pastecs (for descriptive statistics) dplyr (for various data skills and the pipe operator %&gt;%) pander (to format R output for use in rmarkdown documents) broom (for tidy printing of fitted models) multcomp (for multiple comparisons) visreg (for visualizing regression models) car (for various functions used in regression) emmeans (for computing marginal effects from regression models) 6.2 Probability distributions You will have encountered a number of probability distributions before. For example, the Binomial distribution is a model for the distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of independent trials, for example, the number of heads in a coin tossing experiment. Another commonly used discrete distribution is the Poisson, which is a useful model for many kinds of count data. Of course, the most important distribution of all is the Normal or Gaussian distribution. R provides sets of functions to find densities, cumulative probabilities, quantiles, and to draw random numbers from many important distributions. The names of the functions all consist of a one letter prefix that specifies the type of function and a stem which specifies the distribution. Look at the examples in the table below. Prefix Meaning d density p cumulative probability q quantile r simulate Suffix Meaning binom Binomial pois Poisson norm Normal t Student’s t chisq Chi-squared f F Using the prefix and the suffix, we can construct each desired function. For example, # Calculate the probability of 3 heads out of 10 tosses of a fair coin. # This is a (d)ensity of a (binom)ial distribution. dbinom(3, 10, 0.5) ## [1] 0.1171875 # Calculate the probability that a normal random variable (with # mean of 3 and standard deviation of 2) is less than or equal to 4. # This is a cumulative (p)robability of a (norm)al variable. pnorm(4, 3, 2) ## [1] 0.6914625 # Find the t-value that corresponds to a 2.5% right-hand tail probability # with 5 degrees of freedom. # This is a (q)uantile of a (t)distribution. qt(0.975, 5) ## [1] 2.570582 # Simulate 5 Poisson random variables with a mean of 3. # This is a set of (r)andom numbers from a (pois)son distribution. rpois(5, 3) ## [1] 1 3 3 3 5 See the help page ?Distributions for more details. To make a quick plot of a distribution, we can use the density function in combination with curve. The following code makes Fig. 6.1. # A standard normal distribution curve(dnorm(x, sd=1, mean=0), from=-3, to=3, ylab=&quot;Density&quot;, col=&quot;blue&quot;) # Add a t-distribution with 3 degrees of freedom. curve(dt(x, df=3), from =-3, to=3, add=TRUE, col=&quot;red&quot;) # Add a legend (with a few options, see ?legend) legend(&quot;topleft&quot;, c(&quot;Standard normal&quot;,&quot;t-distribution, df=3&quot;), lty=1, col=c(&quot;blue&quot;,&quot;red&quot;), bty=&#39;n&#39;, cex=0.8) Figure 6.1: Two univariate distributions plotted with curve() Make a histogram of a sample of random numbers from a distribution of your choice. use hist and one of the functions starting with r from above. 6.3 Descriptive Statistics Descriptive statistics summarise some of the properties of a given data set. Generally, we are interested in measures of location (central tendency, such as mean and median) and scale (variance or standard deviation). Other descriptions can include the sample size, the range, and so on. We already encountered a number of functions that can be used to summarize a vector. Let’s look at some examples for the Pupae dataset. # Read data data(pupae) # Extract the weights (for convenience) weight &lt;- pupae$PupalWeight # Find the number of observations length(weight) ## [1] 84 # Find the average (mean) weight mean(weight) ## [1] 0.3110238 # Find the Variance var(weight) ## [1] 0.004113951 Note that R will compute the sample variance (not the population variance). The standard deviation can be calculated as the square root of the variance, or use the sd function directly. # Standard Deviation sqrt(var(weight)) ## [1] 0.06414009 # Standard Deviation sd(weight) ## [1] 0.06414009 Robust measures of the location and scale are the median and inter-quartile range; R has functions for these. # median and inter-quartile range median(weight) ## [1] 0.2975 IQR(weight) ## [1] 0.09975 The median is the 50th percentile or the second quartile. The quantile function can compute quartiles as well as arbitrary percentiles/quantiles. # Default: computes quartiles. quantile(weight) ## 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% ## 0.17200 0.25625 0.29750 0.35600 0.47300 # Or set any quantiles quantile(weight, probs=seq(0,1,0.1)) ## 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% ## 0.1720 0.2398 0.2490 0.2674 0.2892 0.2975 0.3230 0.3493 0.3710 0.3910 ## 100% ## 0.4730 Missing Values: All of the above functions will return NA if the data contains any missing values. However, they also provide an option to remove missing values (NAs) before their computations (see also Section 3.7.3). mean(pupae$Frass) ## [1] NA mean(pupae$Frass, na.rm=TRUE) ## [1] 1.846446 The summary function provides a lot of the above information in a single command: summary(weight) ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. ## 0.1720 0.2562 0.2975 0.3110 0.3560 0.4730 The moments package provides ‘higher moments’ if required, for example, the skewness and kurtosis. # load the moments package library(moments) skewness(weight) ## [1] 0.3851656 kurtosis(weight) ## [1] 2.579144 The pastecs package includes a useful function that calculates many descriptive statistics for numeric vectors, including the standard error for the mean (for which R has no built-in function). library(pastecs) ## ## Attaching package: &#39;pastecs&#39; ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:magrittr&#39;: ## ## extract ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:dplyr&#39;: ## ## first, last # see ?stat.desc for description of the abbreviations stat.desc(weight) ## nbr.val nbr.null nbr.na min max ## 84.000000000 0.000000000 0.000000000 0.172000000 0.473000000 ## range sum median mean SE.mean ## 0.301000000 26.126000000 0.297500000 0.311023810 0.006998258 ## CI.mean.0.95 var std.dev coef.var ## 0.013919253 0.004113951 0.064140091 0.206222446 # conveniently, the output is a character vector which we can index by name, # for example extracting the standard error for the mean stat.desc(weight)[&quot;SE.mean&quot;] ## SE.mean ## 0.006998258 Sometimes you may wish to calculate descriptive statistics for subgroups in the data. We will come back to this extensively in Section 4.1.1 and later sections. 6.4 Testing differences between groups 6.4.1 Testing a single sample In some applications we simply want to know whether the mean of our data (the sample) is equal to some hypothesized value, or whether it is clearly higher or lower. The simplest approach is to compute a 95% confidence interval for the mean, and then check whether the hypothesized value falls inside this interval (in which case you cannot conclude the value is different). One way to get confidence intervals in R is to use the quantile functions for the relevant distribution. A \\(100(1-\\alpha)\\)% confidence interval for the mean on normal population is given by, \\[\\bar{x} \\pm t_{\\alpha/2, n-1} \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\] where \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sample mean, \\(s\\) the sample standard deviation and \\(n\\) is the sample size. \\(t_{\\alpha/2, n-1}\\) is the \\(\\alpha/2\\) tail point of a \\(t\\)-distribution on \\(n-1\\) degrees of freedom. That is, if \\(T\\) has a \\(t\\)-distribution on \\(n-1\\) degrees of freedom. \\[P(T \\leq t_{\\alpha/2, n-1}) = 1-\\alpha/2 \\] The R code for this confidence interval can be written as, # Sample data - the pupae data. data(pupae) weight &lt;- pupae$PupalWeight # 95% confidence interval - set to 0.1 for a 90% interval alpha &lt;- 0.05 xbar &lt;- mean(weight) s &lt;- sd(weight) n &lt;- length(weight) half.width &lt;- qt(1-alpha/2, n-1)*s/sqrt(n) # Confidence Interval c(xbar - half.width, xbar + half.width) ## [1] 0.2971046 0.3249431 Here, we assumed a normal distribution for the population. You may have been taught that if n is large, say n&gt;30, then you can use a normal approximation. That is, replace qt(1-alpha/2, n-1) with qnorm(1-alpha/2), but there is no need, R can use the t-distribution for any n (and the results will be the same, as the t-distribution converges to a normal distribution when the df is large). Confirm that the \\(t\\)-distribution converges to a normal distribution when n is large (using qt and qnorm). 6.4.2 Hypothesis testing There may be a reason to ask whether a dataset is consistent with a certain mean. For example, are the pupae weights consistent with a population mean of 0.29? For normal populations, we can use Student’s \\(t\\)-test, available in R as the t.test function. In all following results, we use the pander function (from the pander) package to make the output short and readable (and in markdown format). For best results, use it in an rmarkdown document (though it works fine otherwise as well). We assume you have loaded these two packages: library(pander) library(dplyr) Let’s test the null hypothesis that the population mean is 0.29: t.test(weight, mu=0.29) %&gt;% pander One Sample t-test: weight Test statistic df P value Alternative hypothesis mean of x 3.004 83 0.00352 * * two.sided 0.311 Note that we get the t-statistic, degrees of freedom (n-1) and a P value for the test, with the specified alternative hypothesis (not equal, i.e. two-sided). In addition, t.test gives us the estimated mean of the sample. We can use t.test to do one-sided tests, t.test(weight, mu=0.29, alternative=&quot;greater&quot;) %&gt;% pander One Sample t-test: weight Test statistic df P value Alternative hypothesis mean of x 3.004 83 0.00176 * * greater 0.311 The t.test is appropriate for data that is approximately normally distributed. You can check this using a histogram or a QQ-plot. If the data is not very close to a normal distribution then the t.test is often still appropriate, as long as the sample is large. If the data is not normal and the sample size is small, there are a couple of alternatives: transform the data (often a log transform is enough) or use a nonparametric test, in this case the Wilcoxon signed rank test. We can use the wilcox.test function for the latter, its interface is similar to t.test and it tests the hypothesis that the data is symmetric about the hypothesized population mean. For example, wilcox.test(weight, mu=0.29) %&gt;% pander Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction: weight Test statistic P value Alternative hypothesis 2316 0.009279 * * two.sided 6.4.2.1 Test for proportions Sometimes you want to test whether observed proportions are consistent with a hypothesized population proportion. For example, consider a coin tossing experiment where you want to test the hypothesis that you have a fair coin (one with an equal probability of landing heads or tails). In your experiment, you get 60 heads out of 100 coin tosses. Do you have a fair coin? We can use the prop.test function: # 60 &#39;successes&#39; out of a 100 trials, the hypothesized probability is 0.5. prop.test(x=60, n=100, p=0.5) %&gt;% pander 1-sample proportions test with continuity correction: 60 out of 100, null probability 0.5 Test statistic df P value Alternative hypothesis p 3.61 1 0.05743 two.sided 0.6 Likewise, we can perform one-sided tests with the argument alternative=\"greater\" (not shown). 6.4.3 Inference for two populations Commonly, we wish to compare two (or more) populations. For example, the pupae dataset has pupal weights for female and male pupae. We may wish to compare the weights of males (gender=0) and females (gender=1). To compare the pupal weights of males and females, we use the formula interface for t.test. The formula interface is important because we will use it in many other functions, like linear regression and linear modelling. # (output not shown) # We assume equal variance between the groups, giving slightly more power, # but see section &#39;unequal variances&#39; further below. t.test(PupalWeight ~ Gender, data=pupae, var.equal=TRUE) 6.4.3.1 Paired data The t.test can also be used when the data are paired, for example, measurements taken before and after some treatment on the same subjects. For this example, we will use the pulse data - data on pulse rates of individuals before and after exercise. We will test the simple idea that pulse rate is different after exercise. To do this, we first extract only those subjects that exercised (Ran=1), # (output not shown) pulse &lt;- read.table(&quot;ms212.txt&quot;, header=TRUE) pulse.before &lt;- with(pulse, Pulse1[Ran==1]) pulse.after &lt;- with(pulse, Pulse2[Ran==1]) t.test(pulse.after, pulse.before, paired=TRUE) 6.4.3.2 Unequal variances The default for the two-sample t.test is actually to not assume equal variances. The theory for this kind of test is quite complex, and the resulting \\(t\\)-test is now only approximate, with an adjustment called the ‘Satterthwaite’ or ‘Welch’ approximation made to the degrees of freedom. t.test(PupalWeight ~ Gender, data=pupae) %&gt;% pander Welch Two Sample t-test: PupalWeight by Gender (continued below) Test statistic df P value Alternative hypothesis -7.413 74.63 1.587e-10 * * * two.sided mean in group 0 mean in group 1 0.2725 0.3513 Since this modified t-test makes fewer assumptions, you could ask why we ever use the equal variances form. If the assumption is reasonable, then this (equal variances) form will have more power, i.e. will reject the null hypothesis more often when it is actually false. 6.4.4 Testing many groups at once (ANOVA) One-way ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAriance) can be used to compare means across two or more populations. We will not go into the theory here, but the foundation of ANOVA is comparing the variation between the group means to the variation within the groups (using an F-statistic). We can use either the aov function or lm to perform ANOVAs. We will focus exclusively on the latter as it can be generalized more easily to other models. The use of aov is only appropriate when you have a balanced design (i.e., the same sample sizes in each of your groups). To use lm for an ANOVA, we need a dataframe containing a (continuous) response variable and a factor variable that defines the groups. For example, in the Coweeta dataset, the species variable is a factor that defines groups by species. We can compute (for example) the mean height by species. Let’s look at an example using the Coweeta data, but with only four species to simplify the output. library(dplyr) # Take a subset and drop empty levels with droplevels. data(coweeta) cowsub &lt;- filter(coweeta, species %in% c(&quot;bele&quot;,&quot;cofl&quot;,&quot;oxar&quot;,&quot;quru&quot;)) %&gt;% droplevels # # Quick summary table (uses dplyr) group_by(cowsub, species) %&gt;% summarize(height = mean(height)) ## # A tibble: 4 x 2 ## species height ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 bele 21.9 ## 2 cofl 6.80 ## 3 oxar 16.5 ## 4 quru 21.1 We might want to ask, does the mean height vary by species? Before you do any test for significance, a graphical summary of the data is always useful. For this type of data, box plots are preferred since they visualize not just the means but also the spread of the data (Fig. 6.2). boxplot(height~species, data=cowsub) Figure 6.2: Simple box plot for the Coweeta data. It seems like some of the species differences are quite large. We can fit a one-way ANOVA with lm, like so: fit1 &lt;- lm(height ~ species, data=cowsub) The fitted coefficients can be seen in summary(fit1), or more concisely with coef(fit1), but we prefer the use of the broom package, especially the functions tidy and glance : library(broom) tidy(fit1) ## # A tibble: 4 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 21.9 1.56 14.0 7.02e-14 ## 2 speciescofl -15.1 2.93 -5.15 2.04e- 5 ## 3 speciesoxar -5.36 2.35 -2.28 3.04e- 2 ## 4 speciesquru -0.761 2.27 -0.335 7.40e- 1 Here, tidy gives the table of coefficients. Notice the four estimated Coefficients, these represent the so-called contrasts. In this case, Intercept represents the mean of the first species, bele. The next three coefficients are the differences between each species and the first (e.g., species cofl has a mean that is -15.07 lower than bele). Also shown are the t-statistic (and p-value) for each coefficient, for a test where the value is compared to zero. Not surprisingly the Intercept (i.e., the mean for the first species) is significantly different from zero (as indicated by the very small p-value). Two of the next three coefficients are also significantly different from zero. We can get more details of the fit using glance. glance(fit1) ## # A tibble: 1 x 11 ## r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic p.value df logLik AIC BIC ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 0.533 0.481 4.95 10.3 1.11e-4 4 -91.4 193. 200. ## # ... with 2 more variables: deviance &lt;dbl&gt;, df.residual &lt;int&gt; Here we see various useful statistics including the R squared (goodness of fit), and the p-value of the overall model. This p-value tells us whether the whole model is significant. In this case, it is comparing a model with four coefficients (one for each species) to a model that just has the same mean for all groups. In this case, the model is highly significant – i.e. there is evidence of different means for each group. In other words, a model where the mean varies between the four species performs much better than a model with a single grand mean. 6.4.5 Multiple comparisons The ANOVA, as used in the previous section, gives us a single p-value for the overall ‘species effect’. The summary statement further shows whether individual species are different from the first level in the model, which is not always useful. If we want to know whether the four species were all different from each other, we can use a multiple comparison test. Multiple comparisons on linear models where you have more than one factor variable are tricky, and probably best left alone. Read the help page ?glht for more information. We will use the glht function from the multcomp package (as a side note, base R includes the TukeyHSD function, but that does not work with lm, only with aov). # First fit the linear model again (a one-way ANOVA, # because species is a factor) lmSpec &lt;- lm(height ~ species, data=cowsub) # Load package library(multcomp) # Make a &#39;general linear hypothesis&#39; object, Tukey style. # (Note many other options in ?glht) tukey_Spec &lt;- glht(lmSpec, linfct=mcp(species=&quot;Tukey&quot;)) # Print a summary. This shows p-values for the null hypotheses # that species A is no different from species B, and so on. summary(tukey_Spec) ## ## Simultaneous Tests for General Linear Hypotheses ## ## Multiple Comparisons of Means: Tukey Contrasts ## ## ## Fit: lm(formula = height ~ species, data = cowsub) ## ## Linear Hypotheses: ## Estimate Std.

In the above summary of the multiple comparison (summary(tukey_Spec)), the p-values are adjusted for multiple comparisons with the so-called ‘single-step method’. To use a different method for the correction (there are many), try the following example: summary(tukey_Spec, test=adjusted(\"Shaffer\")) Also look at the other options in the help pages for ?adjusted and ?p.adjust. We can also produce a quick plot of the multiple comparison, which shows the pair-wise differences between the species with confidence intervals. This code produces Fig. 6.3. # A plot of a fitted &#39;glht&#39; object (multiple comparison) plot(tukey_Spec) Figure 6.3: A standard plot of a multiple comparison. 6.4.6 Comparing many groups by two predictors (two-way ANOVA) Sometimes there are two (or more) treatment factors. The ‘age and memory’ dataset (see ?memory) includes the number of words remembered from a list for two age groups and five memory techniques. This dataset is balanced, as shown below. in a table of counts for each of the combinations. First we fit a linear model of the main effects. data(memory) # To make the later results easier to interpret, reorder the Process # factor by the average number of words remembered. memory &lt;- mutate(memory, Process = reorder(Process, Words, mean)) # Count nr of observations xtabs( ~ Age + Process, data=memory) ## Process ## Age Counting Rhyming Adjective Imagery Intentional ## Older 10 10 10 10 10 ## Younger 10 10 10 10 10 # Fit linear model fit2 &lt;- lm(Words ~ Age + Process, data=memory) # Full output (not shown) # summary(fit2) # Instead, show just coefficient summary table in nice format broom::tidy(fit2) ## # A tibble: 6 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 5.20 0.763 6.81 8.99e-10 ## 2 AgeYounger 3.10 0.623 4.97 2.94e- 6 ## 3 ProcessRhyming 0.5 0.985 0.507 6.13e- 1 ## 4 ProcessAdjective 6.15 0.985 6.24 1.24e- 8 ## 5 ProcessImagery 8.75 0.985 8.88 4.41e-14 ## 6 ProcessIntentional 8.90 0.985 9.03 2.10e-14 The summary of the fitted model displays the individual t-statistics for each estimated coefficient. As with the one-way ANOVA, the significance tests for each coefficient are performed relative to the base level (by default, the first level of the factor). In this case, for the Age factor, the Older is the first level, and for the Process factor, Adjective is the first level. Thus all other coefficients are tested relative to the “Older/Adjective” group. The \\(F\\)-statistic at the end is for the overall model, it tests whether the model is significantly better than a model that includes only a mean count. If we want to see whether Age and/or Process have an effect, we need F-statistics for these terms. Throughout this book, to compute p-values for terms in linear models, we use the Anova function from the car package. # Perform an ANOVA on a fitted model, giving F-statistics library(car) Anova(fit2) ## Anova Table (Type II tests) ## ## Response: Words ## Sum Sq Df F value Pr(&gt;F) ## Age 240.25 1 24.746 2.943e-06 *** ## Process 1514.94 4 39.011 &lt; 2.2e-16 *** ## Residuals 912.60 94 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 In this form, the \\(F\\)-statistic is formed by comparing models that do not include the term, but include all others. For example, Age is tested by comparing the full model against a model that includes all other terms (in this case, just Process). 6.4.7 Interactions An important question when we have more than one factor in an experiment is whether there are any interactions. For example, do Process effects differ for the two Age groups, or are they simply additive? We can add interactions to a model by modifying the formula. An interaction is indicated using a “:”. We can also include all main effects and interactions using the * operator. # Two equivalent ways of specifying a linear model that includes all main effects # and interactions: fit3 &lt;- lm(Words ~ Age + Process + Age:Process, data=memory) # Is the same as: fit3.2 &lt;- lm(Words ~ Age * Process, data=memory) Anova(fit3.2) ## Anova Table (Type II tests) ## ## Response: Words ## Sum Sq Df F value Pr(&gt;F) ## Age 240.25 1 29.9356 3.981e-07 *** ## Process 1514.94 4 47.1911 &lt; 2.2e-16 *** ## Age:Process 190.30 4 5.9279 0.0002793 *** ## Residuals 722.30 90 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 The Anova table shows that the interaction is significant. When an interaction is significant, this tells you nothing about the direction or magnitude of the interaction term. You can inspect the estimated coefficients in the summary output, but we recommend to first visualize the interaction with simple plots, as the coefficients can be easily misinterpreted. One way to visualize the interaction is to use the interaction.plot function, as in the following example. This code produces Fig. 6.4. If there were no interaction between the two factor variables, you would expect to see a series of parallel lines (because the effects of Process and Age would simply be additive). # Plot the number of words rememberd by Age and Process # This standard plot can be customized in various ways, see ?interaction.plot with(memory, interaction.plot(Age, Process, Words)) Figure 6.4: An interaction plot for the memory data, indicating a strong interaction (because the lines are not parallel). When there is a signficant interaction term, we might want to know under what levels of one factor is the effect of another factor signficant. This can be done easily using functions in the emmeans package. Load the emmeans package, and run the code fit3.emm &lt;- emmeans(fit3, ~ Age | Process), followed by pairs(fit3.emm). You can now inspect in great detail differences between levels of your predictors. 6.4.8 Comparing models In the above example, we fitted two models for the Memory dataset: one without, and one with the interaction between Process and Age. We assessed the significance of the interaction by inspecting the p-value for the Age:Process term in the Anova statement. Another possibility is to perform a likelihood ratio test on two ‘nested’ models, the model that includes the term, and a model that excludes it. We can perform a likelihood ratio test with the anova function, not to be confused with Anova from the car package! # We can perform an anova on two models to compare the fit. # Note that one model must be a subset of the other model. # In this case, the second model has the same predictors as the first plus # the interaction, and the likelihood ratio test thus tests the interaction. anova(fit2,fit3) ## Analysis of Variance Table ## ## Model 1: Words ~ Age + Process ## Model 2: Words ~ Age + Process + Age:Process ## Res.Df RSS Df Sum of Sq F Pr(&gt;F) ## 1 94 912.6 ## 2 90 722.3 4 190.3 5.9279 0.0002793 *** ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 A second common way to compare different models is by the AIC (Akaike’s Information Criterion), which is calculated based on the likelihood (a sort of goodness of fit), and penalized for the number of parameters (i.e. number of predictors in the model). The model with the lowest AIC is the preferred model. Calculating the AIC is simple, AIC(fit2, fit3) ## df AIC ## fit2 7 518.9005 ## fit3 11 503.5147 We once again conclude that the interaction improved the model fit substantially. 6.4.9 Diagnostics The standard ANOVA assumes normality of the residuals, and we should always check this assumption with some diagnostic plots (Fig. 6.5). Although R has built-in diagnostic plots, we prefer the use of qqPlot and residualPlot, both from the car package. par(mfrow=c(1,2)) library(car) # Residuals vs. fitted residualPlot(fit3) # QQ-plot of the residuals qqPlot(fit3) ## [1] 26 86 Figure 6.5: Simple diagnostic plots for the Memory ANOVA. The QQ-plot shows some slight non-normality in the upper right. The non-normality probably stems from the fact that the Words variable is a ‘count’ variable. Check whether a log-transformation of Words makes the residuals closer to normally distributed. 6.5 Linear regression 6.5.1 Icecream sales: a motivating example It is well known that ice cream sales are higher during warm weather. As an ice cream salesman, you hardly have to apply regression analysis to know this - it is just obvious. Suppose that one year, you sell icecream at Oosterpark in Amsterdam. Sales are pretty good, the summer is nice and warm. The next year you try your luck at the Dappermarkt, a busy market in the east of Amsterdam. You tally your sales every week, and finally make a plot comparing average weekly sales: data(icecream) library(ggplot2) library(ggthemes) ggplot(icecream, aes(x = location, y = sales, fill = location)) + scale_fill_manual(values=c(&quot;white&quot;,&quot;grey&quot;)) + geom_boxplot() + theme(aspect.ratio = 2, legend.position=&quot;none&quot;) + lims(y=c(0,1200)) Figure 6.6: Average weekly ice cream sales at two locations, over two years Based on this simple boxplot, you would either conclude that there is no difference in sales, or that perhaps sales were slightly better in Oosterpark. We can also perform a t-test for two samples, which tests the hypothesis that the two means are not different (in other words, location has no effect on sales). t.test(sales ~ location, data=icecream) ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: sales by location ## t = -1.3227, df = 36.442, p-value = 0.1942 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -183.16655 38.51966 ## sample estimates: ## mean in group Dappermarkt mean in group Oosterpark ## 660.4856 732.8090 The example above - as all other examples in this chapter - shows the raw output produced by R. To produce attractive output for use in an rmarkdown document, use the pander package: pander::pander(t.test(sales ~ location, data=icecream)). The pander function also works for many other R objects. From this test we conclude no difference: the P value is very large (meaning the observed sample difference is not unusual, and could have easily arisen by chance). Of course, there is something rather fishy about this experiment. We are testing the difference between two locations - but both locations were ‘tested’ in different years, when other conditions may have been different. In other words, we have not performed a proper experiment at all - changing just one variable at a time - location is confounded by the year. We do not need to get into detail here to design a proper scientific ice cream sales experiment, instead we are going to make the point that we can account for some confounding variables via regression analysis. How about temperature? As an astute ice cream salesman, you downloaded weekly average air temperature for Amsterdam, and added these to the data. Now let’s make a plot using air temperature as a covariate. # Assuming you have loaded ggplot2 and ggthemes ggplot(icecream, aes(x = temperature, y = sales, fill = location)) + geom_point(shape = 21, size=3) + scale_fill_manual(values = c(&quot;white&quot;,&quot;dimgrey&quot;)) + lims(y=c(0,1200), x=c(0,35)) Figure 6.7: Ice cream sales by location, and varying with temperature. In this figure we arrive at a completely different conclusion - but only because we have taken into account the covariate weekly temperature. Now, at a given temperature, ice cream sales were higher at the new location - Dappermarkt. This is an example of how a confounding variable can mask (or even reverse) effects of some other variable. It seems obvious from the figure that temperature was overall lower when you sold ice cream at the Dappermarkt, explaining why average weekly sales were in the end no different. Use a t-test to test that temperature was lower at the Dappermarkt location. Using regression analysis, we can test the assertion that ice cream sales are higher at Dappermarkt, at a given temperature. But before we do that, we first introduce the tools to test difference between means (as we just did with a simple two-sample t-test), and introduce basic linear regression. We return to the icecream problem in Section 6.6.2. 6.5.2 Simple and multiple linear regression To fit linear models of varying complexity, we can use the lm function. The simplest model is a straight-line relationship between an x and a y variable. In this situation, the assumption is that the y-variable (the response) is a linear function of the x-variable (the independent variable), plus some random noise or measurement error. For the simplest case, both x and y are assumed to be continuous variables. We use this method to study the relationship between two continuous variables: a response (‘y variable’) and a predictor (or independent variable) (‘x variable’). We can use multiple regression to study the relationship between one response and more than one predictor. We are going to use the Cereals data to inspect the “health rating” (rating), and two predictors: fibre content (fiber) and sugar content (sugar). To start with, let’s make two scatter plots, side by side. # Read the data, if you haven&#39;t already data(cereals) library(scales) library(gridExtra) # Two simple scatter plots on a log-log scale g1 &lt;- ggplot(cereals, aes(y = rating, x = fiber)) + geom_point(pch=15) + lims(y=c(0,100)) + geom_smooth(method=&#39;lm&#39;) g2 &lt;- ggplot(cereals, aes(y = rating, x = sugars)) + geom_point(pch=19, col=&quot;dimgrey&quot;) + lims(y=c(0,100)) + geom_smooth(method=&#39;lm&#39;) grid.arrange(g1, g2, ncol = 2) Figure 6.8: Leaf area as a function of height and diameter (note the log-log scale). Here we make use of ggplot2’s built-in regression lines, which are easily added to the plot. The default behaviour is to add a 95% confidence band as well. In this case we immediately see that fiber is a worse predictor than sugars for the health rating, given the wider confidence interval for the location of the mean response (i.e. the regression line). We are going to fit a model that looks like, using statistical notation, \\[\\begin{equation} y = \\alpha+\\beta_1 x_1 +\\beta_2 x_2 +\\varepsilon \\tag{6.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\alpha\\) is the intercept, \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are the two predictors (fiber and sugars), and the two slopes are \\(\\beta_1\\) and \\(\\beta_2\\). We are particularly interested in testing for significant effect of both predictors, which is akin to saying that we are testing the values of the two slopes against zero. # Fit a multiple regression without interactions, and inspect the summary fit4 &lt;- lm(rating ~ sugars + fiber, data=cereals) # A detailed summary (not shown for brevity) # summary(fit4) # A clean summary, especially for in an rmarkdown file fit4 %&gt;% pander Fitting linear model: rating ~ sugars + fiber Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|) (Intercept) 52.17 1.556 33.54 4.266e-46 sugars -2.244 0.1632 -13.75 5.975e-22 fiber 2.867 0.2979 9.623 1.276e-14 As you can see, we again use the pander package to give super clean results, which can be used in an rmarkdown document. We see here that overall we have an R2 of 81% (not bad), and that both predictors contribute significantly (the P values are very low for both). Next, we perform some diagnostic plots (shown in Fig. 6.9). The standard errors (and confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests) will be unreliable if the assumptions of normality (right panel) or linearity (left panel) are seriously violated. If you are only interested in the mean response against your predictors, but not so much their uncertainties, you can usually ignore these plots. # Basic diagnostic plots. par(mfrow=c(1,2)) car::residualPlot(fit4) car::qqPlot(fit4) Figure 6.9: Diagnostic plots for linear regression of the Cereals data. ## [1] 27 31 Now that we have a fitted model, what do its predictions actually look like? What relationship have we learned between health rating, sugars, and fiber content? The visreg package provides a very concise method to visualize (many kinds of) fitted regression models. In this case, the command visreg::visreg(fit4) would show two plots very similar to the ones above - which does not really add much information. What if we can show the effects of both predictors, in just one plot? The following code produces Fig. 6.10. library(visreg) visreg(fit4, &quot;sugars&quot;, by = &quot;fiber&quot;, overlay = TRUE, gg = TRUE) + lims(y = c(0,100)) Figure 6.10: Visualizing linear regression of the Cereals data with visreg. Here we clearly, and in one panel, visualize the negative effect of adding more sugar in a cereal, and the positive effect of adding more fiber. The visreg function plots the predictions from our model at an arbitrary selection of predictor values (here, 0, 1.5 and 5). In the call to visreg, use the argument breaks=c(1,5) to set the predictor values to those of your choice. We can also make 3D plots, though these are not always useful, and I personally prefer a ‘pseudo-3D’ plot as in the example above to visualize the contribution of two variables. Of course, we are not restricted to just two predictors, and we can include interactions as well. In the previous model (fit4) the effects of fiber and sugars were additive, in other words the effect of fiber was independent of the amount of sugars. We can test this assumption by adding the interaction to the model. # A multiple regression that includes all main effects as wel as interactions fit5 &lt;- lm(rating ~ sugars + fiber + fiber:sugars, data=cereals) summary(fit5) %&gt;% pander::pander(.)

We can also inspect the AIC, and notice that the total model AIC has not decreased, which also indicates the model has not improved by adding an interaction term. AIC(fit4, fit5) ## df AIC ## fit4 4 496.1572 ## fit5 5 496.7359 6.6 Linear models with factors and continuous variables So far we have looked at ANOVA, including two-way ANOVA, where a response variable is modelled as dependent on two treatments or factors, and regression including multiple linear regression where a response variable is modelled as dependent on two continuous variables. These are just special cases of the linear model, and we can extend these simple models by including a mix of factors and continuous predictors. The situation where we have one continuous variable and one factor variable was classicallyknown as ANCOVA (analysis of covariance), but using thelm` function we can specify any model with a combination of predictors. In the following example, we inspect the height of trees against the stem diameter (DBH) for the Coweeta example dataset. When plotting all data, we are led to believe that the overall response of height to DBH is highly non-linear (left panel). However, when we fit a simple linear model for each species separately (right panel), the relationship appears to consist of a combination of linear responses. data(coweeta) g1 &lt;- ggplot(coweeta, aes(x = DBH, y = height)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=&quot;loess&quot;, se=FALSE) + scale_colour_tableau() + lims(x=c(0,60), y=c(0,30)) g2 &lt;- ggplot(coweeta, aes(x = DBH, y=height, col=species)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;, se=FALSE) + scale_colour_tableau() + lims(x=c(0,60), y=c(0,30)) grid.arrange(g1, g2, ncol = 2, widths=c(0.4, 0.6)) To fit a model that allows a different response for each species, we use the notation from before: fit6 &lt;- lm(height ~ species * DBH, data=coweeta) 6.6.1 Visualizing fitted regression models The coefficients associated with a factor predictor in a linear model are given as contrasts (i.e. differences between factor levels). While this is useful for comparisons of treatments, it is often more instructive to visualize the predictions at various combinations of factor levels. A number of options exist to extract and visualize fitted regression models - to make sense of differences between groups, the effects of covariates, and the impact of interactions. We prefer the visreg package, which can be used to make attractive plots of the predictions of a linear model. The following example makes Fig. 6.11. library(visreg) # Load data (lgrdata package needed) data(memory) # To make the later results easier to interpret, reorder the Process # factor by the average number of words rememberer (we did this earlier in # the chapter already for this dataset, it is repeated here). memory &lt;- mutate(memory, Process = reorder(Process, Words, mean)) # Two linear models: one without, and one with an interaction fit7 &lt;- lm(Words ~ Age + Process, data=memory) fit8 &lt;- lm(Words ~ Age*Process, data=memory) # Here we specify which variable should be on the X axis (Process), # and which variable should be added with different colours (Age). visreg(fit7, &quot;Process&quot;, by=&quot;Age&quot;, overlay=TRUE) visreg(fit8, &quot;Process&quot;, by=&quot;Age&quot;, overlay=TRUE) Figure 6.11: Visualization of two fitted linear model with the visreg package. The model on the right includes an interaction between Process and Age, the model on the left does not. You can test for yourself that the interaction is a highly significant predictor in the model. 6.6.2 Group differences in regression models: back to ice cream sales At the beginning of this chapter (Section 6.5.1), we looked at an example where including a covariate drastically changed our conclusions about an effect. Simply testing the difference between two locations where we sold ice creams showed no effect, but including temperature at a covariate, it appeared that at a given temperature, there was a difference between the locations. Here, we continue this example as it shows that we need to closely inspect a fitted model before making any conclusions - and that estimated coefficients of a regression model can lead to wrong conclusions, if not carefully examined. To continue, first read in the icecream data as shown in Section 6.5.1. We now fit a linear model with one numeric, and one factor variable. We immediately include all effects, including the interaction. lm_ice1 &lt;- lm(sales ~ location * temperature, data=icecream) You can inspect all details in the summary of this model yourself (summary(lm_ice1)) - here we just look at the estimated coefficients from the model. Recall that in a linear model, the intercept is assigned to the first level of the factor variable in the model, in this case levels(icecream$location) shows that this is ‘Dappermarkt’. pander(lm_ice1) Fitting linear model: sales ~ location * temperature Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|) (Intercept) 78.41 27.72 2.829 0.00759 locationOosterpark 99.64 42.53 2.343 0.02477 temperature 37.48 1.704 22 1.837e-22 locationOosterpark:temperature -11.19 2.255 -4.963 1.683e-05 Four coefficients are shown, these are: Intercept : ice cream sales for the first level of ‘Location’ (Dappermarkt), when temperature equals zero (i.e. the intersection of the regression line with the y-axis when x = 0). locationOosterpark : The difference in intercept for Oosterpark location, compared to the first level (Dappermarkt). A positive value here seems to indicate higher sales at the Oosterpark location (when temperature is zero - read further below!). temperature : The slope of sales per unit temperature (i.e. for every degree increase in temperature, sales go up this much), for Dappermarkt. locationOosterpark:temperature : the difference in slope for the Oosterpark, compared to Dappermarkt. This shows the slope is lower for Oosterpark. Based on the above, it seems difficult to draw conclusions about the difference between locations. This is because the intercept is not at all informative: it quantifies ice cream sales when temperature equals zero, but we do not even try to sell ice cream when it is cold outside. To visualize what is going on, we modify the standard visreg plot to draw the regression lines all the way to zero. We also show how to adjust the appearance of the plot (see ?plot.visreg for details). visreg(lm_ice1, &quot;temperature&quot;, by=&quot;location&quot;, overlay = TRUE, xlim=c(0,40), line.par=list(col=c(&quot;dimgrey&quot;,&quot;grey&quot;)), fill.par=list(col=c(&quot;#BEBEBE80&quot;,&quot;#BEBEBE80&quot;)), points.par=list(col=c(&quot;dimgrey&quot;,&quot;grey&quot;), cex=1.2)) We now see that the regression lines ‘cross over’ around a temperature of 10, giving a higher intercept for Oosterpark. A meaningful test in situations like this is to test for group differences at a given value of our covariate(s). A number of approaches exist in various add-on packages, but we prefer to first show the basic approach using predict - a function that has methods for practically all models we use. It also offers great flexibility, and we don’t have to wonder what exactly we are testing. Somewhat arbitrarily, we want to test for location differences at a temperature of 25 degrees. To do this, I will construct confidence intervals for both locations, as follows. In the call to predict, it is important to list values for all variables in the model. This makes this approach less practical for models with many more regressors (see below for another approach). # Predict from model, at temperature =25. pred_ice &lt;- predict(lm_ice1, newdata = data.frame(temperature = 25, location = levels(icecream$location)), se = TRUE) If you inspect this object, you will find that sales at Dappermarkt are 1015.4 with a standard error of 18.1, and sales at Oosterpark are 835.2 (SE 10.1). The standard errors may be used to construct approximate 95% confidence intervals (by using twice the standard error). A more convenient approach is to use the emmeans package to extract marginal effects of our fitted model. The default approach in this package is to test for group differences at the average level of other predictors. This approach is also called ‘least-square means’. However, we can adjust what value we want to use. library(emmeans) emmeans(lm_ice1, specs = &quot;location&quot;, at = list(temperature = 25)) ## NOTE: Results may be misleading due to involvement in interactions ## location emmean SE df lower.CL upper.CL ## Dappermarkt 1015 18.1 36 979 1052 ## Oosterpark 835 10.1 36 815 856 ## ## Confidence level used: 0.95 You can ignore the warning in this case, since we have used both the predictors in our model - there are no other ‘hidden’ predictors that may complicate matters. As you can see for yourself, the emmeans package gives the same results as the basic predict approach, but it is certainly much more practical. 6.6.3 Logarithmic transformation For data that are very heteroscedasctic, that is, have quickly increasing variance with the value of the predictor, it is usually necessary to use a logarithm transformation of the data. In extreme cases, not applying the log-transform leads to very poor model fits, with very large influence of a few points, and possibly a fit that does not describe the data well at all. See Fig. 6.12 for an example where a log-transform is used. data(coweeta) library(scales) g1 &lt;- ggplot(coweeta, aes(x = biomass, y = folmass)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Mass of tree (kg)&quot;, y = &quot;Mass of leaves (kg)&quot;) g2 &lt;- g1 + scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10() + annotation_logticks() + expand_limits(x=c(1,10^4), y=100) grid.arrange(g1, g2, ncol = 2) Figure 6.12: An example of a dataset that screams for a logarithmic transformation. Left panel: untransformed data, showing very non-constant variance, indicating larger variation in the response variable for larger individuals. Right panel: both variables have been log-transformed, giving a nice linear relationship with constant variance. Redo the above plot, using origin (i.e. American, Japanese or European) to color the symbols. This is another good example that you should always consider covariates in a linear model. The following code fits two linear models to the data above, one to the raw, untransformed data, and one after log10-transforming both the predictor and the response variable. In previous examples we used residualPlot from the car package to quickly make plots of residuals versus fitted values, here we implement a simple version using ggplot2 (and note that we jump ahead and define our own function, a topic we return to in Chapter 7). lm1 &lt;- lm(folmass ~ biomass, data = coweeta) lm2 &lt;- lm(log10(folmass) ~ log10(biomass), data = coweeta) residPlot &lt;- function(model){ ggplot(model, aes(.fitted, .resid)) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method=&quot;loess&quot;, span=0.8) } grid.arrange(residPlot(lm1), residPlot(lm2), ncol = 2) Figure 6.13: Residuals versus fitted for the Coweeta biomass regression model, either without (left panel) or with (right panel) log-transformation of x and y variables. As Fig. 6.13 shows, the log-transformation results in much better model diagnostics. We can expect that the model will give an overall better fit to the data, because when we did not transform, the location of the regression line will be overly influenced by values far away from the line. After transformation, this effect will be much reduced, and the model will be more robust. Second, the standard errors of the coefficients in the untransformed fit are very much biased, leading to confidence intervals that are much too narrow. In this case, a log-transformation could be used to remedy this problem, but in other cases we want to avoid transformations, or they are simply not adequate. In that case, we might use the bootstrap. This well known and often used transformation does have some consequences for interpreting the linear model fit that are often misunderstood. The key aspect to understand is that the model is no longer additive as the usual linear model (where effects of predicts are simply added), but rather multiplicative (effects of various predictors are multiplied). This has consequences for understanding interactions in the model as well. 6.6.4 Adding quadratic and polynomial terms So far we have seen models with just linear terms, but it is straightforward and often necessary to add quadratic (\\(x^2\\)) or higher-order terms (e.g. \\(x^3\\)) when the response variable is far from linear in the predictors. You can add any transformation of the predictors in an lm model by nesting the transformation inside the I() function, like so: data(allometry) lmq1 &lt;- lm(height ~ diameter + I(diameter^2), data=allometry) This model fits both the linear (diameter) and squared terms (I(diameter\\^2)) of the predictor, as well as the usual intercept term. If you want to fit all polynomial terms up to some order, you can use the poly function like so, lmq1 &lt;- lm(height ~ poly(diameter, 2), data=allometry) This model specification is exactly equivalent to the above, and is more convenient when you have multiple quadratic / polynomial terms and interactions with factor variables. The following example quickly tests whether a quadratic term improves the model fit of height vs. diameter for the species PIPO in the allometry dataset. data(allometry) pipo &lt;- subset(allometry, species == &quot;PIPO&quot;) # Fit model with the quadratic term: lmq2 &lt;- lm(height ~ diameter + I(diameter^2), data=pipo) # The very small p-value for the quadratic terms shows that the # relationship is clearly not linear, but better described with a # quadratic model. Anova(lmq2) ## Anova Table (Type II tests) ## ## Response: height ## Sum Sq Df F value Pr(&gt;F) ## diameter 821.25 1 53.838 5.905e-07 *** ## I(diameter^2) 365.78 1 23.980 0.0001001 *** ## Residuals 289.83 19 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 When fitting a quadratic model, it is again very useful to use visreg to inspect the model that is estimated, since it becomes even more difficult to make sense of the various linear, quadratic, and intercept terms, especially when interactions with factor variables are added. Consider this example for the allometry dataset, which makes Fig. 6.14. # Fit a linear model with linear, quadratic terms, and all species interactions. allomquadfit &lt;- lm(height ~ poly(diameter, 2)*species, data=allometry) # Inspect summary(allomquadfit) to confirm you cannot possibly make sense of this # many coefficients. # But plotting the predictions is much easier to understand: visreg(allomquadfit, &quot;diameter&quot;, by=&quot;species&quot;, overlay=TRUE) Figure 6.14: Height modelled as a quadratic function of diameter, by species. 6.6.5 Which predictors are more important? Frequently we are interested in knowing which of the predictor variables explain more variation in the response variable, in other words are more strongly correlated with the response. One often-seen approach is to compute all correlations between the response and each of the predictors, and conclude that those with higher correlation coefficients will be most important. The flaw in this approach is that predictor variables are very often correlated with each other, making the approach potentially misleading. Cross-correlations between variables can easily hide important predictor variables. Nonetheless it can be a useful start, as we do here with the automobiles data. The following code makes Fig. 6.15. data(automobiles) # A modern implementation of a correlation plot in the corrplot package. library(corrplot) auto_cor &lt;- cor(automobiles[,4:9], use = &quot;complete.obs&quot;) corrplot(auto_cor, method = &quot;ellipse&quot;) Figure 6.15: Correlation plot for the automobiles data. As we can see in Fig. 6.15, the response variable (fuel_efficiency) seems well correlated with four of the response variables, but weaker with acceleration. Sometimes we see the use of the absolute value of the t-statistic to rank variables by ‘importance’ in the regression model. Within a single model, the t-statistic will be exactly related to the p-value (low p-values mean large t-statistic). Both t-statistics and p-values are very poor measures of importance. A large t-statistic may also arise when the sample size is large, the measurements are accurate, or there is low variability overall. Instead what we are often interested in is how much variation is explained by each variable in the model. This calculation is complicated by the fact that predictor variables tend to be correlated with each other, so you cannot simply add up the R2 due to each predictor separately. The relaimpo package includes a number of importance measures - the recommended version can be interpreted as the % variation explained by each predictor variable: # A model with five predictors fit_fuel1 &lt;- lm(fuel_efficiency ~ cylinders + engine_volume + horsepower + weight + acceleration, data = automobiles) # For importance measures library(relaimpo) # recommended method lmg in relaimpo imp_fitfuel &lt;- calc.relimp(fit_fuel1, type=&quot;lmg&quot;) # The resulting object is a bit complicated. # If you print the object (simply type imp_fitfuel), lots of information is given. # Instead we just need this: sort(imp_fitfuel$lmg, TRUE) ## weight horsepower engine_volume cylinders acceleration ## 0.21667697 0.19895781 0.18619931 0.17158534 0.04737539 The values mean that weight explains 21% of the variation, but acceleration only 4%. Note that the sum of these values adds up (nearly precisely) to the R2 of the model (look at summary(fit_fuel1)). A more common approach is to test how mucb the R2 decreases if a predictor is dropped from the model. When important variables are removed, the model fits a lot worse overall. This can be achieved via: drop1(fit_fuel1) Where RSS is the ‘residual sum of squares’ after dropping the term; higher means the variable is ‘more important’. 6.7 Exercises 6.7.1 Probabilities For this exercise, refer to the tables and examples in Section 6.2. For a normal random variable \\(X\\) with mean 5.0, and standard deviation 2.0, find the probability that \\(X\\) is less than 3.0. Find the probability that \\(X\\) is greater than 4.5. Find the value \\(K\\) so that \\(P(X &gt; K) = 0.05\\). When tossing a fair coin 10 times, find the probability of seeing no heads (Hint: this is a binomial distribution). Find the probability of seeing exactly 5 heads. Find the probability of seeing more than 7 heads. 6.7.2 Univariate distributions Simulate a sample of 100 random data points from a normal distribution with mean 100 and standard deviation 5, and store the result in a vector called x. Plot a histogram and a boxplot of the vector you just created (see Section5.2.3). If you haven’t make a boxplot, simply use the boxplot function on your vector! Calculate the sample mean, standard deviation, median and interquartile range. Using the data above, test the hypothesis that the mean equals 100 (using t.test). In science, it is customary (though debatable) to call an effect significant if the p-value is smaller than 0.05. Note that here we test whether the true mean is different from 100 - in this case we know the true mean since the data were sampled from a normal distribution with mean 100. Bonus question: how often do we find a p-value smaller than 0.05 in this example, do you think? (that is, resampling the data from step 1., and then testing). Test the hypothesis that mean equals 90. Repeat the above two tests using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. Compare the p-values with those from the \\(t\\)-tests you just did. 6.7.3 More \\(t\\)-tests For this question, use the pupae data. Use the t.test function to compare PupalWeight by T_treatment. Repeat above using a Wilcoxon rank sum test. ## Warning in wilcox.test.default(x = c(0.244, 0.319, 0.221, 0.28, 0.257, ## 0.333, : cannot compute exact p-value with ties Run the following code to generate some data: base &lt;- rnorm(20, 20, 5) x &lt;- base + rnorm(20,0,0.5) y &lt;- base + rnorm(20,1,0.5) Using a two-sample t-test compare the means of x and y, assume that the variance is equal for the two samples. Repeat the above using a paired \\(t\\)-test. How has the \\(p\\)-value changed? Which test is most appropriate? 6.7.4 Simple linear regression Continue with the pupae data. Perform a simple linear regression of Frass on PupalWeight. Produce and inspect the following: Summary of the model. Diagnostic plots. All of the above for a subset of the data, where Gender is 0, and CO2\\_treatment is 400. 6.7.5 Quantile Quest You have already used quantile-quantile (QQ) plots many times, but in this exercise you will get to the bottom of the idea of comparing quantiles of distributions. As in the previous exercises, we will use the pupae data. From the pupae data, extract PupalWeight and store it as a vector called ‘pupweight’. Make a histogram of this vector (5.2.3), noticing that the distribution seems perhaps quite like the normal distribution. When we say ‘quite like the normal distribution’, we mean that the overall shape seems similar. Now simulate a histogram like the one above, using rnorm with the mean and standard deviation of the pupal weights (i.e. pupweight), and the same sample size as well. Plot it repeatedly to get an idea of whether the simulated histogram looks similar often enough. Of course a visual comparison like that is not good enough, but it is a useful place to start. We can also compare the quantiles as follows. If we calculate the 25% and 75% quantiles of pupweight, we are looking for the values below which 25% or 75% of all observations occur. Clearly if two distributions have the same shape, their quantiles should be roughly similar. Calculate the 25, 50 and 75% quantiles for pupweight, and also calculate them for the normal distribution using qnorm. Are they similar? Now repeat the above exercise, but calculate many quantiles (e.g. from 2.5% to 97.5% with steps of 2.5% or whatever you choose) for both the measured data, and the standard normal distribution. Compare the two with a simple scatter plot, and add a 1:1 line. If you are able to do this, you just made your own QQ-plot (and if not, I suggest you inspect the solutions to this Exercise). Hint: use seq to make the vector of quantiles, and use it both in quantile and qnorm. Save the results of both those as vectors, and plot. As a comparison, use qqPlot(pupweight, distribution=\"norm\") (car package), make sure to plot the normal quantiles on the X-axis. 6.7.6 One-way ANOVA For the titanic data, use a one-way ANOVA to compare the average passenger age by passenger class. (Note: by default, lm will delete all observations where Age is missing.) For the Age and Memory data (Section@ref(agemem}, p. sec:agemem}), make a subset of the Older subjects, and conduct a one-way ANOVA to compare words remembered by memory technique. 6.7.7 Two-way ANOVA Using the pupae dataset, fit a two-way ANOVA to compare PupalWeight to Gender and CO2_treatment. Which main effects are significant? After reading in the pupae data, make sure to convert Gender and CO2_treatment to a factor first (see Section3.7.1). Is there an interaction between Gender and CO2_treatment? Repeat the above using T_treatment instead of CO2_treatment. 6.7.8 Regression: the pulse dataset The pulse data contains measurements of heart rate (“pulse”) for individuals before and after running (and some control individuals) - and the individuals’ height, weight and age (and other interesting variables). The Pulse1 variable is the resting heart rate before any treatment, and Pulse2 the heart rate after the treatment (half the subjects engaged in running). Read the data and fit a multiple linear regression of Pulse1 against Age, Weight and Height (add the variables to the model in that order). Are any terms significant at the 5% level? What is the R2? Now also include the factor Exercise in the regression model (an indicator of whether the subject exercises frequently or not). You will need to first convert Exercise to a factor as it is stored numerically in the data. Does adding Exercise improve the model? Using the same data, fit a model of Pulse2 as a function of Pulse1 and Ran as main effects only (Note: convert Ran to a factor first). Use the visreg package to understand the fit. Now add the interaction between Pulse1 and Ran. Is it significant? Also look at the effects plot, how is it different from the model without an interaction? Read Section 6.6.5 on variable importance. Add a new variable to the pulse dataset, as the difference between Pulse2 and Pulse1 (the change in heartrate after exercise). Now fit a linear regression model with all of these terms: “Height”, “Weight”, “Age”, “Gender”, “Smokes”, “Alcohol”,“Exercise”,“Ran”. As expected Ran wil be most important, but how do all the other variables rank in importance? 6.7.9 Logistic regression Using the Pulse data once more, build a model to see if Pulse2 can predict whether people were in the Ran group. Make sure that Ran is coded as a factor. The visreg package is very helpful in visualizing the fitted model. For the logistic regression you just fit , run the following code and make sure you understand the output. (This code assumes you called the object fit6, if not change fit6 to the name you used.) "],
["programming.html", "Chapter 7 Functions, lists and loops 7.1 Introduction 7.2 Writing simple functions 7.3 Working with lists 7.4 Loops 7.5 Exercises", " Chapter 7 Functions, lists and loops 7.1 Introduction This chapter demonstrates some building blocks of programming with R. The main purpose here is to allow batch analyses - repeating similar tasks for many subsets of data. To do this, we first have to know how to write our own functions, so that we can apply the custom function to any new subset of data. This approach results in far less, and much more readable code than copy-pasting similar code for different datasets. We also delve into “lists” in R, a versatile data object that you have worked with already - even if you didn’t know it. Understanding lists well in R is the key to more complex analyses, and more readable workflows. Finally we take a brief look at ‘for loops’, a basic programming utility that we rarely need in R, since almost all functions are vectorized. Sometimes it is however more convenient to use loops, or makes the code just a little more easy to work with. Packages used in this chapter We use no new packages in this chapter except the wrapr package. All other functionality is included in base R, or commonly used packages dplyr, ggplot2, lubridate, and lgrdata for the example data. 7.2 Writing simple functions We have already used many built-in functions throughout this tutorial, but you can become very efficient at complex data tasks when you write your own simple functions. Writing your own functions can help with tasks that are carried out many times, which would otherwise result in a lot of code. For example, suppose you frequently convert units from pounds to kilograms. It would be useful to have a function that does this, so you don’t have to type the conversion factor every time. This is also good practice, as it reduces the probability of making typos. # This function takes a &#39;weight&#39; argument and multiplies it with some number # to return kilograms. poundsToKg &lt;- function(weight){ weight * 0.453592 } We can use this function just like any other in R, for example, let’s convert ‘weight’ to kilograms in the weightloss data. # Read data library(lgrdata) data(weightloss) # Convert weight to kg. weightloss$Weight &lt;- poundsToKg(weightloss$Weight) Let’s write a function for the standard error of the mean, a function that is not built-in in R. # Compute the standard error of the mean for a vector SEmean &lt;- function(x){ se &lt;- sd(x) / sqrt(length(x)) return(se) } Here, the function SEmean takes one ‘argument’ called x (i.e., input), which is a numeric vector. The standard error for the mean is calculated in the first line, and stored in an object called se, which is then returned as output. We can now use the function on a numeric vector like this: # A numeric vector unifvec &lt;- runif(10, 1,2) # The sample mean mean(unifvec) ## [1] 1.549763 # Standard error for the mean SEmean(unifvec) ## [1] 0.09274072 You can use functions that you defined yourself just like any other function, for example in summaryBy. First read in the SEmean function defined in the example above, and then use the cereal data to calculate the mean and SE of rating by Manufacturer (or use data of your choosing). 7.2.1 Functions with many arguments Functions can also have multiple arguments. The following very simple function takes two numbers, and finds the absolute difference between them, using abs. # Define function absDiff &lt;- function(num1,num2)abs(num1 - num2) # Test it with two numbers: absDiff(5,1) ## [1] 4 # As in many functions in R, you can also give multiple values # as an argument. # The following returns the absolute difference between # 1 and 3, then 5 and 6, and 9 and 0 (in that order). absDiff(c(1,5,9), c(3,6,0)) ## [1] 2 1 9 7.2.2 Functions can return many results What if a function should return not just one result, as in the examples above, but many results? For example, this function computes the standard deviation and standard error of a vector, and returns both stored in a vector. Note that we also use the SEmean function, which we defined above. # An function that computes the SE and SD of a vector seandsd &lt;- function(x){ seresult &lt;- SEmean(x) sdresult &lt;- sd(x) # Store results in a vector with names vec &lt;- c(seresult, sdresult) names(vec) &lt;- c(&quot;SE&quot;,&quot;SD&quot;) return(vec) } # Test it: x &lt;- rnorm(100, mean=20, sd=4) seandsd(x) ## SE SD ## 0.3573251 3.5732505 7.2.3 Functions without arguments Sometimes, a function takes no arguments (input) at all. Consider this very helpful example. sayhello &lt;- function()message(&quot;Hello!&quot;) sayhello() ## Hello! We will return to defining our own functions when we look at applying functions many times to sections of a dataframe (Section 7.3.6). 7.2.4 Wrapper functions We often need to write simple functions that adjust one or two arguments to other functions. For example, suppose we often make plots with filled circles, with our favorit color (“dimgrey”) : library(lgrdata) data(howell) plot(age, height, data=howell, pch=19, col=&quot;dimgrey&quot;) We could of course always specify these arguments, or we can write a function that sets those defaults. It would look like the following, except this function is incomplete, since we have hardcoded the other plotting arguments (the dataset, and the x and y variables): # This function is not how we want it yet! plot_filled_grey &lt;- function(){ plot(age, height, data=howell, pch=19, col=&quot;dimgrey&quot;) } We would like to be able to call the function via plot_filled_grey(age, height, data=howell), in other words all arguments to our wrapper function should be passed to the underlying function. We have a very handy utility in R to do this, the three dots (...) : plot_filled_grey &lt;- function(...){ plot(..., pch=19, col=&quot;dimgrey&quot;) } The function now works as intended. It can be further improved if we realize that the plotting color cannot be changed - it is always “dimgrey”. We want the default value to be “dimgrey”, but with an option to change it. This can be achieved like so, plot_filled_grey &lt;- function(..., col=&quot;dimgrey&quot;){ plot(..., pch=19, col=col) } Here, col=col sets the color in the call to plot with the default value specified in the wrapper function (“dimgrey”), but the user can also change it as usual. Take the plot_filled_grey function above, test it on some data, and modify it so that the plotting symbol can also be changed, but has a default value of 19. 7.2.5 Wrapper functions to ggplot2 or dplyr In the previous section we saw how to write wrapper functions, functions that change a few arguments to some other function. These sort of functions are very helpful because we can save a lot of space by reusing a certain template. Suppose we want to make a plot with ggplot2, a scatter plot with a loess smoother line. We can achieve this via (result not shown), data(howell) library(ggplot2) ggplot(howell, aes(x = weight, y = height)) + geom_point(size = 0.8, col = &quot;dimgrey&quot;) + stat_smooth(method = &quot;loess&quot;, span = 0.7, col=&quot;black&quot;) We already used quite a bit of code for this simple plot, but imagine you have set various other options, formatting changes, axis limits and so on - you end up with a lot of code for one plot. If we want to reuse the code for another plot, for two other variables from the same dataframe, copy-pasting the code and modifying leads to even more code. Writing wrapper functions for ggplot2 (or dplyr, see below, or many other cases) is more difficult because the arguments in the ggplot2 code we want to change (height and weight) are not quoted - they are variables inside a dataframe (howell in our case). We avoid a more technical explanation of this problem, but simply present a solution with the wrapr package. Using let from wrapr, we can turn our unquoted variables into quoted ones, like so: library(wrapr) let(c(xvar = &quot;weight&quot;, yvar = &quot;height&quot;), { ggplot(howell, aes(x = xvar, y = yvar)) + geom_point(size = 0.8, col = &quot;dimgrey&quot;) }) The point of placing our plotting code inside let is that we can now write our simple wrapper function like before: # Make a scatter plot with the howell data. plot_scatter_howell &lt;- function(xcol, ycol){ let(c(xvar = xcol, yvar = ycol), { ggplot(howell, aes(x = xvar, y = yvar)) + geom_point(size = 0.8, col = &quot;dimgrey&quot;) }) } # The function can be used with quoted names: plot_scatter(&quot;height&quot;, &quot;weight&quot;) It is important to understand that, in this example, let is used only to turn character arguments into unquoted names, in this case “height” turns into height for use in ggplot, and so on. We cannot pass height and weight as unquoted names, because R would look for those objects directly (from the ‘global environment’), rather than as variables in the howell dataset. To also pass the dataset as an argument (making the function more general), we do not have to use let, but can immediately set it as an argument (because it is available in the global environment). # Our function now also takes a dataset as an argument plot_scatter &lt;- function(xcol, ycol, dataset){ let(c(xvar = xcol, yvar = ycol), { ggplot(dataset, aes(x = xvar, y = yvar)) + geom_point(size = 0.8, col = &quot;dimgrey&quot;) }) } # We can use it as, plot_scatter(&quot;height&quot;, &quot;weight&quot;, howell) 7.3 Working with lists Sofar, we have worked a lot with vectors, with are basically strings of numbers or bits of text. In a vector, each element has to be of the same data type. Lists are a more general and powerful type of vector, where each element of the list can be anything at all. This way, lists are a very flexible type of object to store a lot of information that may be in different formats. Lists can be somewhat daunting for the beginning R user, which is why most introductory texts and tutorials skip them altogether. However, with some practice, lists can be mastered from the start. Mastering a few basic skills with lists can really help increase your efficiency in dealing with more complex data analysis tasks. To make a list from scratch, you simply use the list function. Here is a list that contains a numeric vector, a character vector, and a dataframe: mylist &lt;- list(a=1:10, txt=c(&quot;hello&quot;,&quot;world&quot;), dfr=data.frame(x=c(2,3,4),y=c(5,6,7))) 7.3.1 Indexing lists To extract an element from this list, you may do this by its name (‘a’,‘txt’ or ‘dfr’ in this case), or by the element number (1,2,3). For lists, we use a double square bracket for indexing. Consider these examples, # Extract the dataframe: mylist[[&quot;dfr&quot;]] ## x y ## 1 2 5 ## 2 3 6 ## 3 4 7 # Is the same as: mylist$dfr ## x y ## 1 2 5 ## 2 3 6 ## 3 4 7 # Extract the first element: mylist[[1]] ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Note that in these examples, the contents of the elements of the list are returned (for ‘dfr’, a dataframe), but the result itself is not a list anymore. If we select multiple elements, the result should still be a list. To do this, use the single square bracket. Look at these examples: # Extract the &#39;a&#39; vector, result is a vector: mylist[[&#39;a&#39;]] ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 # Extract the &#39;a&#39; vector, result is a list: mylist[&#39;a&#39;] ## $a ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 # Extract multiple elements (result is still a list): mylist[2:3] ## $txt ## [1] &quot;hello&quot; &quot;world&quot; ## ## $dfr ## x y ## 1 2 5 ## 2 3 6 ## 3 4 7 7.3.2 Converting lists to dataframes or vectors Although lists are the most flexible way to store data and other objects in larger, more complex, analyses, ultimately you would prefer to output as a dataframe or vector. Let’s look at some examples using do.call(rbind,...) and unlist. # A list of dataframes: dfrlis &lt;- list(data1=data.frame(a=1:3,b=2:4), data2=data.frame(a=9:11,b=15:17)) dfrlis ## $data1 ## a b ## 1 1 2 ## 2 2 3 ## 3 3 4 ## ## $data2 ## a b ## 1 9 15 ## 2 10 16 ## 3 11 17 # Since both dataframes in the list have the same number of columns and names, # we can &#39;successively row-bind&#39; the list like this: do.call(rbind, dfrlis) ## a b ## data1.1 1 2 ## data1.2 2 3 ## data1.3 3 4 ## data2.1 9 15 ## data2.2 10 16 ## data2.3 11 17 # A list of vectors: veclis &lt;- list(a=1:3, b=2:4, f=9:11) # In this case, we can use the &#39;unlist&#39; function, which will # successively combine the three vectors into one: unlist(veclis) ## a1 a2 a3 b1 b2 b3 f1 f2 f3 ## 1 2 3 2 3 4 9 10 11 In real-world applications, some trial-and-error will be necessary to convert lists to more pretty formats. 7.3.3 Combining lists Combining two lists can be achieved using c(), like this: veclis &lt;- list(a=1:3, b=2:4, f=9:11) qlis &lt;- list(q=17:15) c(veclis,qlis) ## $a ## [1] 1 2 3 ## ## $b ## [1] 2 3 4 ## ## $f ## [1] 9 10 11 ## ## $q ## [1] 17 16 15 # But be careful when you like to quickly add a vector # the &#39;veclis&#39;. You must specify list() like this veclis &lt;- c(veclis, list(r=3:1)) 7.3.4 Extracting output from built-in functions One reason to gain a better understanding of lists is that many built-in functions return not just single numbers, but a diverse collection of outputs, organized in lists. Think of the linear model function (lm), it returns a lot of things at the same time (not just the p-value). Let’s take a closer look at the lm output to see if we can extract the adjusted R\\(^2\\). # Read data data(allometry) # Fit a linear model lmfit &lt;- lm(height ~ diameter, data=allometry) # And save the summary statement of the model: lmfit_summary &lt;- summary(lmfit) # We already know that simply typing &#39;summary(lmfit)&#39; will give # lots of text output. How to extract numbers from there? # Let&#39;s look at the structure of lmfit: str(lmfit_summary) ## List of 11 ## $ call : language lm(formula = height ~ diameter, data = allometry) ## $ terms :Classes &#39;terms&#39;, &#39;formula&#39; language height ~ diameter ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;variables&quot;)= language list(height, diameter) ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;factors&quot;)= int [1:2, 1] 0 1 ## .. .. ..- attr(*, &quot;dimnames&quot;)=List of 2 ## .. .. .. ..$ : chr [1:2] &quot;height&quot; &quot;diameter&quot; ## .. .. .. ..$ : chr &quot;diameter&quot; ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;term.labels&quot;)= chr &quot;diameter&quot; ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;order&quot;)= int 1 ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;intercept&quot;)= int 1 ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;response&quot;)= int 1 ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;.Environment&quot;)=&lt;environment: R_GlobalEnv&gt; ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;predvars&quot;)= language list(height, diameter) ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;dataClasses&quot;)= Named chr [1:2] &quot;numeric&quot; &quot;numeric&quot; ## .. .. ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:2] &quot;height&quot; &quot;diameter&quot; ## $ residuals : Named num [1:63] -8.84 1.8 0.743 2.499 4.37 ... ## ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:63] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;4&quot; ... ## $ coefficients : num [1:2, 1:4] 7.5967 0.5179 1.4731 0.0365 5.157 ... ## ..- attr(*, &quot;dimnames&quot;)=List of 2 ## .. ..$ : chr [1:2] &quot;(Intercept)&quot; &quot;diameter&quot; ## .. ..$ : chr [1:4] &quot;Estimate&quot; &quot;Std.

Also look at the help file ?summary.lm, in the section ‘Values’ for a description of the fields contained here. To extract the adjusted R\\(^2\\), for example: lmfit_summary[[&quot;adj.r.squared&quot;]] ## [1] 0.7639735 # Is the same as: lmfit_summary$adj.r.squared ## [1] 0.7639735 This sort of analysis will be very useful when we do many regressions, and want to summarize the results in a table. Run the code in the above examples, and practice extracting some other elements from the linear regression. Compare the output to the summary of the lm fit (that is, compare it to what summary(lmfit) shows on screen). 7.3.5 Creating lists from dataframes For more advanced analyses, it is often necessary to repeat a particular analysis many times, for example for sections of a dataframe. Using the allom data for example, we might want to split the dataframe into three dataframes (one for each species), and repeat some analysis for each of the species. One option is to make three subsets (using subset), and repeating the analysis for each of them. But what if we have hundreds of species? A more efficient approach is to split the dataframe into a list, so that the first element of the list is the dataframe for species 1, the 2nd element species 2, and so on. In case of the allom dataset, the resulting list will have three components. Let’s look at an example on how to construct a list of dataframes from the allom dataset, one per species: # Read allom data and make sure &#39;species&#39; is a factor: data(allometry) is.factor(allometry$species) ## [1] TRUE # The levels of the factor variable &#39;species&#39; levels(allometry$species) ## [1] &quot;PIMO&quot; &quot;PIPO&quot; &quot;PSME&quot; # Now use &#39;split&#39; to construct a list: allomsp &lt;- split(allometry, allometry$species) # The length of the list should be 3, with the names equal to the # original factor levels: length(allomsp) ## [1] 3 names(allomsp) ## [1] &quot;PIMO&quot; &quot;PIPO&quot; &quot;PSME&quot; Run the code in the above example, and confirm that allomsp[[2]] is identical to taking a subset of allom of the second species in the dataset (where ‘second’ refers to the second level of the factor variable species, which you can find out with levels). Let’s look at an example using the hydro data. The data contains water levels of a hydrodam in Tasmania, from 2005 to 2011. # Read hydro data, and convert Date to a proper date class. data(hydro) library(lubridate) library(dplyr) hydro &lt;- mutate(hydro, Date = dmy(Date), year = year(Date)) # Look at the Date range: range(hydro$Date) ## [1] &quot;2005-08-08&quot; &quot;2011-08-08&quot; # Let&#39;s get rid of the first and last years (2005 and 2011) since they are incomplete hydro &lt;- filter(hydro, !year %in% c(2005,2011)) # Now split the dataframe by year. This results in a list, where every # element contains the data for one year: hydrosp &lt;- split(hydro, hydro$year) # Properties of this list: length(hydrosp) ## [1] 5 names(hydrosp) ## [1] &quot;2006&quot; &quot;2007&quot; &quot;2008&quot; &quot;2009&quot; &quot;2010&quot; To extract one element of the two lists that we created (allomsp and hydrosp), recall the section on indexing lists. 7.3.6 Applying functions to lists We will introduce two basic tools that we use to apply functions to each element of a list: sapply and lapply. The lapply function always returns a list, whereas sapply will attempt to simplify the result. When the function returns a single value, or a vector, sapply can often be used. In practice, try both and see what happens! 7.3.6.1 Using sapply First let’s look at some simple examples: # Let&#39;s make a simple list with only numeric vectors (of varying length) numlis &lt;- list(x=1000, y=c(2.1,0.1,-19), z=c(100,200,100,100)) # For the numeric list, let&#39;s get the mean for every element, and count # the length of the three vectors. # Here, sapply takes a list and a function as its two arguments, # and applies that function to each element of the list. sapply(numlis, mean) ## x y z ## 1000.0 -5.6 125.0 sapply(numlis, length) ## x y z ## 1 3 4 You can of course also define your own functions, and use them here. Let’s look at another simple example using the numlis object defined above. For example, # Let&#39;s find out if any diameters are duplicated in the allom dataset. # A function that does this would be the combination of &#39;any&#39; and &#39;duplicated&#39;, anydup &lt;- function(vec)any(duplicated(vec)) # This function returns TRUE or FALSE # Apply this function to numlis (see above): sapply(numlis, anydup) ## x y z ## FALSE FALSE TRUE # You can also define the function on the fly like this: sapply(numlis, function(x)any(duplicated(x))) ## x y z ## FALSE FALSE TRUE Now, you can use any function in sapply as long as it returns a single number based on the element of the list that you used it on. Consider this example with strsplit. # Recall that the &#39;strsplit&#39; (string split) function usually returns a list of values. # Consider the following example, where the data provider has included the units in # the measurements of fish lengths. How do we extract the number bits? fishlength &lt;- c(&quot;120 mm&quot;, &quot;240 mm&quot;, &quot;159 mm&quot;, &quot;201 mm&quot;) # Here is one solution, using strsplit strsplit(fishlength,&quot; &quot;) ## [[1]] ## [1] &quot;120&quot; &quot;mm&quot; ## ## [[2]] ## [1] &quot;240&quot; &quot;mm&quot; ## ## [[3]] ## [1] &quot;159&quot; &quot;mm&quot; ## ## [[4]] ## [1] &quot;201&quot; &quot;mm&quot; # We see that strsplit returns a list, let&#39;s use sapply to extract only # the first element (the number) splitlen &lt;- strsplit(fishlength,&quot; &quot;) sapply(splitlen, function(x)x[1]) ## [1] &quot;120&quot; &quot;240&quot; &quot;159&quot; &quot;201&quot; # Now all you need to do is use &#39;as.numeric&#39; to convert these bits of text to numbers. The main purpose of splitting dataframes into lists, as we have done above, is so that we can save time with analyses that have to be repeated many times. In the following examples, you must have already produced the objects hydrosp and allomsp (from examples in the previous section).Both those objects are lists of dataframes, that is, each element of the list is a dataframe in itself. Let’s look at a few examples with sapply first. # How many observations per species in the allom dataset? sapply(allomsp, nrow) ## PIMO PIPO PSME ## 19 22 22 # Here, we applied the &#39;nrow&#39; function to each separate dataframe. # (note that there are easier ways to find the number of observations per species!, # this is just illustrating sapply.) # Things get more interesting when you define your own functions on the fly: sapply(allomsp, function(x)range(x$diameter)) ## PIMO PIPO PSME ## [1,] 6.48 4.83 5.33 ## [2,] 73.66 70.61 69.85 # Here, we define a function that takes &#39;x&#39; as an argument: # sapply will apply this function to each element of the list, # one at a time. In this case, we get a matrix with ranges of the diameter per species. # How about the correlation of two variables, separate by species: sapply(allomsp, function(x)cor(x$diameter, x$height)) ## PIMO PIPO PSME ## 0.9140428 0.8594689 0.8782781 # For hydro, find the number of days that storage was below 235, for each year. sapply(hydrosp, function(x)sum(x$storage &lt; 235)) ## 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 ## 0 18 6 0 0 7.3.6.2 Using lapply The lapply function is much like sapply, except it always returns a list. For example, # Get a summary of the hydro dataset by year: lapply(hydrosp, summary) ## $`2006` ## Date storage year ## Min. :2006-01-02 Min. :411.0 Min. :2006 ## 1st Qu.:2006-04-01 1st Qu.:449.5 1st Qu.:2006 ## Median :2006-06-29 Median :493.0 Median :2006 ## Mean :2006-06-29 Mean :514.3 Mean :2006 ## 3rd Qu.:2006-09-26 3rd Qu.:553.8 3rd Qu.:2006 ## Max. :2006-12-25 Max. :744.0 Max. :2006 ## ## $`2007` ## Date storage year ## Min. :2007-01-01 Min. :137.0 Min. :2007 ## 1st Qu.:2007-04-02 1st Qu.:223.0 1st Qu.:2007 ## Median :2007-07-02 Median :319.0 Median :2007 ## Mean :2007-07-02 Mean :363.2 Mean :2007 ## 3rd Qu.:2007-10-01 3rd Qu.:477.0 3rd Qu.:2007 ## Max. :2007-12-31 Max. :683.0 Max. :2007 ## ## $`2008` ## Date storage year ## Min. :2008-01-07 Min. :202.0 Min. :2008 ## 1st Qu.:2008-04-05 1st Qu.:267.8 1st Qu.:2008 ## Median :2008-07-03 Median :345.0 Median :2008 ## Mean :2008-07-03 Mean :389.5 Mean :2008 ## 3rd Qu.:2008-09-30 3rd Qu.:551.8 3rd Qu.:2008 ## Max. :2008-12-29 Max. :637.0 Max. :2008 ## ## $`2009` ## Date storage year ## Min. :2009-01-05 Min. :398.0 Min. :2009 ## 1st Qu.:2009-04-04 1st Qu.:467.0 1st Qu.:2009 ## Median :2009-07-02 Median :525.5 Median :2009 ## Mean :2009-07-02 Mean :567.6 Mean :2009 ## 3rd Qu.:2009-09-29 3rd Qu.:677.8 3rd Qu.:2009 ## Max. :2009-12-28 Max. :791.0 Max. :2009 ## ## $`2010` ## Date storage year ## Min. :2010-01-04 Min. :251.0 Min. :2010 ## 1st Qu.:2010-04-03 1st Qu.:316.0 1st Qu.:2010 ## Median :2010-07-01 Median :368.5 Median :2010 ## Mean :2010-07-01 Mean :428.5 Mean :2010 ## 3rd Qu.:2010-09-28 3rd Qu.:577.5 3rd Qu.:2010 ## Max. :2010-12-27 Max. :649.0 Max. :2010 Suppose you have multiple similar datasets in your working directory, and you want to read all of these into one list, use lapply like this (run this example yourself and inspect the results). # Names of your datasets: filenames &lt;- c(&quot;pupae.csv&quot;,&quot;pupae.csv&quot;,&quot;pupae.csv&quot;) # (This toy example will read the same file three times). # Read all files into one list, alldata &lt;- lapply(filenames, read.csv) # Then, if you are sure the datasets have the same number of columns and names, # use do.call to collapse the list: dfrall &lt;- do.call(rbind, alldata) Recall the use of dir to list files, and even to find files that match a specific pattern (see Section 2.8. Read all CSV files in your working directory (or elsewhere) into a single list, and count the number of rows for each dataframe. Finally, we can use lapply to do all sorts of complex analyses that return any kind of object. The use of lapply with lists ensures that we can organize even large amounts of data in this way. Let’s do a simple linear regression of log(leafarea) on log(diameter) for the Allometry dataset, by species: # Run the linear regression on each element of the list, store in a new object: lmresults &lt;- lapply(allomsp, function(x)lm(log10(leafarea) ~ log10(diameter), data=x)) # Now, lmresults is itself a list (where each element is an object as returned by lm) # We can extract the coefficients like this: sapply(lmresults, coef) ## PIMO PIPO PSME ## (Intercept) -0.3570268 -0.7368336 -0.3135996 ## log10(diameter) 1.5408859 1.6427773 1.4841361 # This shows the intercept and slope by species. # Also look at (results not shown): # lapply(lmresults, summary) # Get R2 for each model. First write a function that extracts it. getR2 &lt;- function(x)summary(x)$adj.r.squared sapply(lmresults, getR2) ## PIMO PIPO PSME ## 0.8738252 0.8441844 0.6983126 Try to fully understand the difference between sapply and lapply by using lapply in some of the examples where we used sapply (and vice versa). 7.4 Loops Loops can be useful when we need to repeat certain analyses many times, and it is difficult to achieve this with lapply or sapply. To understand how a for loop works, look at this example: for(i in 1:5){ message(i) } ## 1 ## 2 ## 3 ## 4 ## 5 Here, the bit of code between {} is executed five times, and the object i has the values 1,2,3,4 and 5, in that order. Instead of just printing i as we have done above, we can also index a vector with this object: # make a vector myvec &lt;- round(runif(5),1) for(i in 1:length(myvec)){ message(&quot;Element &quot;, i, &quot; of the vector is: &quot;, myvec[i]) } ## Element 1 of the vector is: 0.5 ## Element 2 of the vector is: 0 ## Element 3 of the vector is: 0.4 ## Element 4 of the vector is: 0.2 ## Element 5 of the vector is: 0.6 Note that this is only a toy example: the same result can be achieved by simply typing myvec. Now let’s look at a useful application of a for loop: producing multiple plots in a pdf, using the allomsp object we created earlier. This bit of code produces a pdf in your current working directory. If you can’t find it, recall that you can use getwd() to get the current working directory. # Open a pdf to send the plots to: pdf(&quot;Allom plot by species.pdf&quot;, onefile=TRUE) for(i in 1:3){ with(allomsp[[i]], plot(diameter, leafarea, pch=15, xlim=c(0,80), ylim=c(0,450), main=levels(allom$species)[i])) } # Close the pdf (important!) dev.off() Here, we create three plots (i goes from 1 to 3), every time using a different element of the list allomsp. First, i will have the value 1, so that we end up using the dataframe allomsp[[1]], the first element of the list. And so on. Take a look at the resulting PDF to understand how the code works. Note: On windows (with Adobe reader) If the pdf (Allom plot by species.pdf) is open, the above will fail. If you try this anyway, close the pdf and try again. You may have to run the command dev.off() another time to make sure the device is ready. Another way to achieve the same result is to avoid splitting the dataframe into a list first, and simply take subsets on the fly. Consider this template (make your own working example based on any dataset). We assume here you have a dataframe called ‘dataset’ with a factor ‘species’, for which you want to create separate plots of Y vs. X. pdf(&quot;somefilename.pdf&quot;, onefile=TRUE) for(lev in levels(dataset$species)){ with(subset(dataset, species==lev), plot(X,Y, main=as.character(lev))) } dev.off() 7.5 Exercises 7.5.1 Writing functions Write a function that adds two numbers, and divides the result by 2. You learned in Section 3.7.4 that you can take subset of a string using the substr function. First, using that function to extract the first 2 characters of a bit of text. Then, write a function called firstTwoChars that extracts the first two characters of any bit of text. Write a function that checks if there are any missing values in a vector (using is.na and any). The function should return TRUE if there are missing values, and FALSE if not. Improve the function so that it tells you which of the values are missing, if any (Hint:use the which function). You can use message to write messages to the console. The function readline can be used to ask for data to be typed in. First, figure out how to use readline by reading the corresponding help file. Then, construct a function called getAge that asks the user to type his/her age. (Hint: check the examples in the readline help page). Hard. Look at the calculations for a confidence interval of the mean in the example in Section 6.4.2. Write a function that returns the confidence interval for a vector. The function should have two inputs: the vector, and the desired ‘alpha’. hard Recall the functions head and tail. Write a function called middle that shows a few rows around (approx.) the ‘middle’ of the dataset. Hint: use nrow, print, and possibly floor. 7.5.2 Working with lists First read the following list: veclist &lt;- list(x=1:5, y=2:6, z=3:7) Using sapply, check that all elements of the list are vectors of the same length. Also calculate the sum of each element. Add an element to the list called ‘norms’ that is a vector of 10 numbers drawn from the standard normal distribution (recall Section 6.2). Using the pupae data, use a \\(t\\)-test to find if PupalWeight varies with temperature treatment, separate for the two CO\\(_2\\) treatments (so, do two \\(t\\)-tests). You must use split and lapply. For this exercise use the coweeta data - a dataset with measurements of tree size. Split the data by species, to produce a list called coweeta_sp. Keep only those species that have at least 10 observations. (Hint: first count the number of observations per species, save that as a vector, find which are at least 10, and use that to subscript the list.) If you don’t know how to do this last step, skip it and continue to the next item. Using the split Coweeta data, perform a linear regression of log10(biomass) on log10(height), separately by species. Use lapply. 7.5.3 Functions for histograms First run this code to produce two vectors. x &lt;- rnorm(100) y &lt;- x + rnorm(100) Run a linear regression y = f(x), save the resulting object. Look at the structure of this object, and note the names of the elements. Extract the residuals and make a histogram. Hard. From the previous question, write a function that takes an lm object as an argument, and plots a histogram of the residuals. 7.5.4 Using functions to make many plots Read the cereals data. Create a subset of data where the Manufacturer has at least two observations (use table to find out which you want to keep first). Don’t forget to drop the empty factor level you may have created! Make a single PDF with six plots, with a scatter plot between potassium and fiber for each of the six (or seven?) Manufacturers. (Hint: ook at the template for producing a PDF with multiple pages at the bottom of Section 7.4. 7.5.5 Monthly weather plots For the HFE weather dataset (hfemet2008) that makes a scatter plot between PAR (a measure of light intensity) and VPD (a measure of the dryness of air). Then, split the dataset by month (recall Section 7.3.5), and make twelve such scatter plots. Save the result in a single PDF, or on one page with 12 small figures. "],
["webservices.html", "Chapter 8 R on the web 8.1 Introduction 8.2 Reading data from remote databases 8.3 Accessing an API 8.4 Deploying an API with plumber", " Chapter 8 R on the web 8.1 Introduction This short chapter will show how to interact with, and deploy web services from R. An API (‘Application Programming Interface’) is a way to access data or services on a server, for example to download or upload data. The most common architecture for APIs is known as RESTful Web Services (or ‘REST API’ for short). We will use the httr package to download data from REST APIs. We start with downloading data from, and querying remotely stored databases, and include two working examples: a database (updated every 15min) in a MongoDB database, and a single table stored in a PostgreSQL database. Packages used in this chapter By now standard packages, lgrdata, dplyr, lubridate plumber for launching web services. DBI to interface with databases. dbplyr to make this interface even easier. purrr (for flatten_dfr, though the package offers much more). 8.2 Reading data from remote databases 8.2.1 NoSQL In this example we show how to read data from MongoDB - a popular NoSQL database. With the mongolite package it is very straightforward to read data that can be transformed to a dataframe. Here, every item in the database is a piece of JSON, but of equal length and with the same names, so that each item can become a row in a dataframe. For a remotely stored MongoDB database, you first have to construct the URL, which includes a username and password. The URL looks like, &quot;mongodb://username:password@hostingsite.com:portnr/databasename&quot; The next example is a working example of a database stored on mlab.com, and grabs data using the mongolite package. The database contains data on number of cars parked on 13 car parks in Almere, the Netherlands. The data are updated every 15 minutes. # A working URL (5/6/2019) parkingdata_url &lt;- &quot;mongodb://guest:123password123@ds229186.mlab.com:29186/almereparking&quot; # library(mongolite) # Make a database connection. Here you don&#39;t download data yet, just # set up a connection. db &lt;- mongo(collection = &quot;almereparkingjson&quot;, url = parkingdata_url) # We can now download the last 1000 rows of the data. parkingdata &lt;- db$find(limit = 1000, sort = &#39;{&quot;updated&quot;: -1}&#39;) If you simply want to download all data, just do db$find(), it takes less than a minute. The above example shows how to make a query with the mongolite package, you can read more options in the documentation. 8.2.2 SQL Here, we briefly show how to interact with SQL databases. There are many R packages available, partly because there are many implementations of SQL databases (including postgres, which we show here). A unified interface is provided by the DBI package (link to documentation), which allows us to use nearly the same code for very different databases. Here, we only show how to read rectangular data with the DBI and dbplyr packages. With dbConnect, we setup a connection to the remotely available database (which does not download data yet). Using the connection we can list the tables available, download a table, and many other things. # General database interface library(DBI) # Drivers for postgres. library(RPostgreSQL) # For generating SQL queries. library(dplyr) library(dbplyr) # Set up connection. # !! This is a working connection (6/5/2019) con &lt;- dbConnect(drv = PostgreSQL(), user = &quot;mjvgsdzg&quot;, password = &quot;RsIxTmV9a95Gbb6Vo7IgG9wZNiv4Hq5L&quot;, host = &quot;balarama.db.elephantsql.com&quot;, port = 5432, dbname = &quot;mjvgsdzg&quot;) # List available tables (only one in this case) dbListTables(con) # Makes a direct connection to the table, but does # not download anything yet: cars &lt;- tbl(con, &quot;automobiles&quot;) # We can download the entire table with collect, # but note that in practice we rarely do this as databases may be extremely large. cars_data &lt;- collect(cars) # We can now make queries using dplyr syntax, to collect only subsets of data. # for example, find all cars with weight over 2000kg. heavycars_query &lt;- cars %&gt;% filter(weight &gt; 2000) # What does the query look like in SQL? show_query(heavycars_query) # Now send the query to the database, collect the data. heavycars &lt;- collect(heavycars_query) # Many other functions from dplyr or other can be used on databases, # but not everything! Some trial and error may be necessary. # Find all cars that have &#39;buick&#39; in the name, using grepl: buick_query &lt;- filter(cars, grepl(&quot;buick&quot;, car_name) ) Run both examples above - getting data from a (continuously updated_ MongoDB database, and a simple static PostreSQL database. Try applying some dplyr filters and summaries on the data. 8.3 Accessing an API A REST API is simply presented as a URL, to which a specific service can be accessed, and even parameters passed (when necessary). A URL may simply look like: https://someserver.com/getdata or may be more complicated, with queries, authentication, and so on. Let’s look a simple example, using the httr package: library(httr) # The first step is to reach out to the server, and get a response. # Here, g is a complicated object that we do not inspect directly. g &lt;- GET(&quot;https://opendata.cbs.nl/ODataApi/OData/37789ksz/TypedDataSet&quot;) # Important: if the server could be reached, you have permission, # and the service is available, you should see 200 as the response. # Other HTML codes include 404 (service not found). status_code(g) ## [1] 200 # We can read the actual data with the `content` function: dat &lt;- content(g) # In this case, dat has two components - the interesting one is &#39;value&#39; uitkering_data_list &lt;- dat$value Unfortunately the result is a nested list, with NULL elements in some. To make this into a dataframe, we want to flatten each list, each of these will become a row in our dataframe, and bind all the rows together. This is such a common problem that I will show a robust solution: library(dplyr) # bind_rows library(purrr) # flatten_dfr uitkering_data &lt;- lapply(uitkering_data_list, flatten_dfr) %&gt;% bind_rows We now have data from the Dutch government on social benefits, a dataset that gets updated frequently. The use of the API directly rather than downloading the data manually is clearly a much better option. As we saw in this example, the challenge is often not so much getting something from the web service, but often we have substantial work to shape it into a useful object in R (usually: a dataframe). Try downloading data from this URL (containing Dutch demography data since 1898). https://opendata.cbs.nl/ODataApi/odata/37556/TypedDataSet 8.4 Deploying an API with plumber With plumber we can quickly set up an API, that we can use from within any other programming language, web site, or program. Normally you would deploy the API on a server running R, so that the R service can be used from anywhere. Here, to keep things simple, we deploy the API on your own machine (‘locally’), but it will work similarly to when it runs on a remote server. The first step is to create a standalone script (with extension .R) that defines as many functions as you like. Each function can take arguments. Take the following example, paste it in a script, call it plumber.R. # plumber.R #* Echo back the input, in uppercase #* @param msg The message to echo #* @get /echo function(msg=&quot;&quot;){ list(msg = paste0(&quot;The message is: &#39;&quot;, toupper(msg), &quot;&#39;&quot;)) } #* Plot a histogram #* @png #* @get /plot function(){ rand &lt;- rnorm(100) hist(rand) } #* Return the sum of two numbers #* @param a The first number to add #* @param b The second number to add #* @get /sum function(a, b){ as.numeric(a) + as.numeric(b) } The first function sends back an uppercase version of a message, the second function plots a histogram, and the third function adds two numbers. Obviously, you can write much, much more complicated R functions that can be subsequently called using the API. These functions are chosen because they return different things: text, a plot, and a number. Let’s see how they work in practice. With our API ‘endpoints’ (the three functions) defined, we can start the API via: library(plumber) # There are no other arguments besides a directory to find the file. p &lt;- plumb(&quot;plumber.R&quot;) # Deploy the API. p$run(port=8001) Your R process will now be busy (until you close it), with a message like: Starting server to listen on port 8001 This will also open up a swagger window, which is a simple interface to our own Web service. Here you can ‘Try out’ the various end points. Try out the web service you just created as follows: open up a browser, and try each of the three endpoints: 127.0.0.1:8001/echo?msg=\"make me uppercase!\" 127.0.0.1:8001/plot\" 127.0.0.1:8001/sum?a=2&amp;b=3\" Now go back to the script above, and notice how each endpoint is defined (echo, plot, and sum) The above example comes straight from the plumber documentation, which you can read here: https://www.rplumber.io/ More complicated examples are available as well.

When you use version control, you can do the following: Keep a history of all the changes you have made to your code. Be able to revert to an old version, or briefly look around in old code, or find any code you have written at some time in the past. Undo fatal coding mistakes. Avoid having multiple versions of the same script (myscrip_v1.R, myscript_v1_mod2.R etc.), and commented-out bits of code that you no longer need. Collaborate with others on the same code, and easily merge the changes you and your collaborators make. Maintain an online backup of your code base. These are all basic capabilities of version control, and as you can see an absolute requirement for even the somewhat serious coder. Here we use version control with git, the most popular system. In this chapter, I will give an informal introduction to version control, and focus on its use in Rstudio. The command line will also be introduced, particularly for somewhat more advanced options. 9.2 Basics of git 9.2.1 Basic principles With git, every folder that you work in can have its own version control repository. This allows you to keep your projects neatly organized in separate folders, each with its own history and set of files that belong together. Organizing code in smaller projects also makes for a natural connection to projects in Rstudio, as we will see shortly. Not all files in the folder need to be kept track of in the git repository. You can specify yourself which files you want to have under version control. Generally speaking it’s up to you which files to track, but a few guidelines are helpful. Mind you that exceptions will arise for each of these ideas; every project is different. It is useful to follow the idea that input files (code, data) are the most important files in your project, whereas output files (figures, processed data, markdown reports, etc.) should be treated as temporary. If you set up your workflow well, you should always be able to generate all outputs from the inputs. As a result, generally speaking **it is a good idea to version control all input files, but none of your output files}. Avoid tracking binary files (non-text files). The two reasons are that a) git cannot see incremental changes to these files (only that the entire file has changed), and b) continuously updating larger binary files will increase the size of the git repository (a collection of hidden files storing your history) - eventually to unmanageable bloatedness. There is no need to track the Rstudio project file (*.Rproj), and probably better if you don’t especially when collaborating. Text-based datasets can be stored very well in git repositories, but that git is not a data management tool per se. It is therefore a bad idea to include large datasets, only smallish datasets in the repository. You can decide manually which files to track, and you can also “ignore” files by listing them in a special file, .gitignore, as we will see later. With git, you can ‘store’ a snapshot of all the tracked files in your repository as often as you like. Normally, this snapshot represents a significant change you made to your code, some new feature added, new figures coded, or whatever. It can be any point during your work where you think it may be useful to return to. With every snapshot, you can decide which changes to the tracked files should be included (‘staged’). It is thus important to realize that a version control repository acts on multiple files in the folder, not separately for each file. This way we can also add and delete files, and keep track of their histories as well (e.g. return to a version of the repository when a particular file was not deleted). When we store a snapshot of the repository, this is called a commit. When we commit changes to the files in the repository, we do this because we may wish to return to this point, or clearly document the changes we have made. When a commit is made, a message has to be written to document what we have done (as we will see further below). Every time we commit, we can manually select which files should be added to the next snapshot. This process is called staging, and it allows you to decide to keep some changes, and undo all other changes, for example. It needs to be stressed that this chapter is a brief non-technical introduction to the topic. It only covers the basic capabilities of git. A very good collection of tutorials and more advanced books is listed on SixRevisions&gt;. 9.2.1.1 Local and remote repositories An important concept when starting with git is that there is a distinction between local and remote repositories. With git, your version control is fundamentally done on your computer, that is, it is a local repository. Optionally, this local repository may be synced with a remote repository (on some online web service). It is thus important to understand that a) you do not need to have a remote repository for git to function (you do not need an internet connection) and b) you must have a local repository even if you also have a remote one. Finally, do not confuse ‘github’ with ‘git’, the former is a website (github.com) used for hosting remote git repositories, the latter is the actual version control system. There are other websites of that kind (for example bitbucket.org). The inventor of git has nothing to do with these websites. 9.2.2 Installing git To get started, first install the actual git program from https://git-scm.com/. During the installation process, do not change any of the defaults, just press OK when prompted. The first time you use git on a computer, you have to set your name and email. These will be appended to each time you commit (very useful when collaborating!). Normally you can open a ‘git bash shell’ (a command line window) from Rstudio, as we show in Section 9.5. This first time, however, you have to find Git Bash in the list of installed programs. With the shell open, type the following commands, using the name and email address you want appended to each commit. You can change this setting any time, the current setting will be applied to the next commit. git config --global user.name &quot;My Name&quot; git config --global user.email &quot;myemail@somewhere.com&quot; To check the settings configuration file (which is stored in your home directory), use : git config --list You can now close the shell. 9.2.3 Using git in Rstudio After installation, Rstudio may have trouble finding the git executable (a reboot may help, but this does not always fix the problem). We can let Rstudio know where git was installed by clicking Browse in the following screenshot (on Windows it will most likely be installed in this exact directory). Click Browse to find the directory where git.exe is installed, on Windows it will be this exact directory. You may not have to do this if you rebooted after installing git. 9.3 Local git repositories Before we turn to remote repositories, we first need a basic understanding of local repositories. Unlike some version control systems, git can work with only a local repository; this can be very useful when you want to commit changes when you are offline. The workflow with a local git repository is as follows: Make changes to your code Stage changes, this will mark the changes to the files to be added to the next ‘commit’. Commit your changes to the local git repository. Repeat. 9.3.1 A first session with version control in Rstudio Let’s start a new Rstudio project with version control. In this example we will make a simple local project, with no remote repository defined. We do that in Section 9.4. To start a new, local, project with git enabled click ‘New Directory’ (not Version Control!). Alternatively you can use an ‘Existing Directory’ and create a project there. On the next tab, select Empty Project, and the following window appears. Here, give the project a reasonable name- it will be used to create a new folder if you selected ‘New Directory’ in the above window. Now, also check the box that says ‘Create git repository’. Enter a name for the new project, the directory where the project will be created (as a sub-directory with the project’s name). Check ‘Create a git repository’ to enable git. Click OK, and if successful, you wil switch to a new instance of Rstudio. The git tab should look like the following figure. What your git tab should look like if you started an empty project in a new directory. The two files in the folder show up with two question marks. This means that git is not sure if you want to track these files. By default, it won’t track them. The .gitignore file is a special file that lists all the files you always will want to ignore. It is very useful and we will use it later. Now, let’s open two new scripts and write some code. I have called my new scripts analysis.R and figures.R. As you expect, these two files will show up in the git tab with two question marks. Notice the Staged column in the above figure? Let’s stage both files by checking them, as in the below figure. Two new files are staged for the next commit. The green ‘A’ means ‘Add’, because these files were not already being tracked by the git repository. We will now make our first commit. With the files staged as in the screenshot, click the ‘Commit’ button. With the two new files staged, you can commit their changes to the local git repository. You must first write a meaningul message in the box on the right. The files will now have disappeared from the git tab. That’s good - their versions are the same as the last time you committed, that is, they have not changed in content. Now let’s modify analysis.R, and delete figures.R (maybe you decided to combine code from these files into a single file), and see what happens. Here we have modified (M) and deleted (D) files that are being tracked by git. Now, stage both files, and press Commit. Write a message that briefly describes your changes and click ‘Commit’ in the next window as well: With the modified and deleted file selected, write a message and click Commit. Let’s now look at the history of our first project sofar. Find the ‘History’ button in the git tab. It will look like the following screenshot. History of the project sofar. The HEAD tag means this is the current location of the working directory. As we will see later, we can check out older versions, in which case HEAD will move to whatever commit we are looking at. Shown are the messages we wrote when committing, the author and date (taken from the git configuration), and the SHA (explained in the next section). Finally, the question marks for .gitignore and the Rproj files can be annoying, and in many projects you will have a long list of files that are in the working directory but you don’t want to track them. 9.3.2 Deleting files and sensitive information Some new users are surprised by how git deals with deleting files in your repository. If you delete a file, git will mark the file as deleted (with a red D in the Rstudio interface), and you can stage the change to also remove the file from git (so it won’t be tracked anymore). Even though the file is deleted, it is still contained in the history of your repository. That means you (or someone else) can return to a state of the repository that included the file, and read its contents. If you accidentally committed a file with sensitive information, such as passwords, deleting the file does not remove it from the history. There is also a way to completely remove files, even from the history, but this is a bit cumbersome and best avoided. Normally we do not like to change history unless some of the files are very large or contain sensitive information. 9.3.3 A few hints The ‘SHA’ is the unique code given to each commit. You normally don’t have to use it in Rstudio, but it is important in the command line commands given below. We never need all characters from the SHA, only the first few (normally 5 or so). You can find the (abbreviated) SHA in the right-hand column of the history. Not all local files are tracked You do not have to commit all changes to the files every time (you can select which ones you want by staging them) Write useful commit messages that make sense a long time from now (saying ‘changed file.txt’ is useless because it will be clear which files you changed anyway). When you reach a particular milestone, include it in the commit message (“version submitted for publication”). Commit often. Don’t wait days to commit all enormous changes to your code. Commit smaller increments of progress (“updated figure 1”, “defined new function for barplots”). only commit code that actually works. There may be exceptions, but you can see this is a good idea. Basically assume that a commit is a point to which you might want to return (for whatever reason). 9.3.4 Reverting changes To undo changes to files in Rstudio, and reset to the last known version of that file (i.e. the the last commit), select the file and click the ‘Revert’ button (this button is only visible in the Commit window, otherwise it is grouped under the ‘More’ button). 9.4 Remote git repositories Version control with git becomes especially useful if you host your code in an online (‘remote’) repository. It is an essential step for collaboration (even if this is just with yourself, on multiple computers). Popular sites to host git repositories are &lt;www.github.com&gt; and &lt;www.bitbucket.org&gt;. I will not provide a guide to using either site, I will leave this to you to figure out. Either way, the first step is to create a user account, and set up the remote to be able to communicate with your computer. A few tips to get started: A remote repository is simply a copy of your local project, think of it as a backup (with some extras). It is generally a good idea to organize your local repositories in a single directory, a location with a short path is useful since you will be accessing your repositories via the command line. You can add git version control to an existing project, but the easiest, most fail-safe way is to create a remote repository, then make a new project in Rstudio pulling from that repository, and adding your files into the project. We will follow this approach below. 9.4.0.1 HTTPS or SSH? There are two ways to connect to a git repository hosted on a remote (like github). The easiest setup is connecting via HTTPS, but this will require you to enter your password every time you try to update the remote. I recommend HTTPS only when you are using a public computer. A better approach is to use SSH, since you never have to type your password - a sort of password will be saved on your computer. 9.4.0.2 Setting up SSH If you are using SSH for authentication, you must first make a sort of password (an ‘SSH key’), which is stored on your computer as well as on the hosting site. This is a straightforward process thanks to Rstudio. Go to Tools/Global Options... then click on the Git/SVN button, and note the ‘SSH/RSA key’ field. This field is probably blank, now click on Create RSA Key. Leave the passphrase blank (unless you would like an extra layer of security), and click OK. Next, click ‘View RSA Key’ (a small link), and copy the key (Ctrl-C). The next step is to paste the SSH key in the remote hosting site, so it knows who you are when you try to use the repository. On bitbucket, when logged in, click ‘Manage Account’, and find ‘SSH Keys’ on the left. Then click ‘Add Key’, and you now have to paste the key that you copied in the previous step. On github, go to Settings/SSH and GPG keys and make a “New SSH key”, and paste it in as above. You can now paste it into the field. Also add a nice label for the key (identifying the computer you are working on). 9.4.1 Making a remote repository Now, let’s create a remote repository. On bitbucket (when you are logged in), click the “+” in the left-hand side menu, on github click the plus (‘+’) button in the top right and Create repository. Decide for yourself on the settings for the repository, such as Private/Public etc. The key thing for us is to find the address of the repository, we need this to use the remote in Rstudio. When using SSH, it will look like (on bitbucket): git@bitbucket.org:remkoduursma/tutorialgit.git When using HTTPS, it will look like this: https://remkoduursma@bitbucket.org/remkoduursma/tutorialgit.git 9.4.1.1 Cloning : make a local copy of a remote repository The easiest approach is to start with an empty remote repository and use it as the basis for a new project in Rstudio. Then, you can add your files to this repository and start tracking (a selection of) them. First, make a remote repository, find the address (SSH or HTTPS, see previous section), and copy it. In Rstudio, go File/New Project.../Version Control/Git and paste the address in the URL box (HTTPS or SSH, it will be recognized). Rstudio is going to create a (nearly empty) folder with a git repository. It will create this as a subfolder of the directory in the window you see (the third field). I recommend you keep your git repositories in a local folder in the root, that contains no spaces in the name. For example, c:/repos/. Paste the remote address of the repository in the first field, the second field will automatically get the name of the remote repository, and for the third field select a directory yourself (but see text). When you click OK, Rstudio should open up with the new project. 9.4.2 Workflow Whether or not you have a remote repository enabled, you will still work in a local repository as explained in Section 9.3, and occassionally synchronize the two. In other words, committing changes is always local. When you want to sync with a remote, you either do a push (send your commits to the remote repository), or a pull (get the latest commits from the remote that you don’t have). It is important to note that you can only push if the local up to date with remote. We will see in the working example how to deal with the situation where we are ‘behind’ the remote (that is, have not included some commits stored in the remote repository). The standard workflow for code stored in a remote repository is: Pull - this makes sure you start with the version contained in the remote repository. Write code, commit changes. Repeat step 2. until you are finished with this session. Push - this sends all the commits you made to the remote repository. It is thus important to understand that you don’t have to push every time you commit changes. In fact it is better if you don’t, because it is easier to fix problems in the local repository, than when the commits have been pushed to the remote. 9.4.3 A session with a remote repository In this section, I will show a typical workflow with a remote repository. In this example I assume you have made a remote repository, and we will clone the empty repository into a new Rstudio project (see ‘Cloning’ in Section 9.4.1. If these first two steps - explained in the previous section - were successful, you now have a new, empty project open in Rstudio. I have copied two scripts that I wrote previously into the folder. In the git tab in Rstudio, you have to ‘stage’ the added files by clicking the check box. The two new files now show up with a green ‘A’ : Adding two files to be included in the next commit. Note that ‘Push’ and ‘Pull’ are greyed out, this is normal because we have no commits in the repository. Next, click commit (opens up a new window), write a reasonable message in the text box on the right, and click ‘Commit’. You now have a single commit in the local repository. Again, it is crucial you understand that this commit is not yet on the remote. Let’s push this first commit to the remote repository. Just click ‘Push’ on the git tab, and a new window opens up in Rstudio with the response from the remote. It will say something like, Response of the remote after the first push (opens in Rstudio when you click ‘push’). Note that a new branch is created because this is the very first commit on the remote repository. All commits will always go to the ‘master’ branch (in this tutorial, at least). Now go to the online version (on github.com or bitbucket.org), and check that your code is really there. Also look for the ‘commits’ (a list of all your commits) and the source code (you can, quite conveniently, browse the code online). Next, suppose you start a new session with this project. As described in Section 9.4.2, you should always start with a pull, except when you are really 100% sure that your local is already up to date with the remote. If you are already up to date, the output will be: Output from a ‘pull’ when the local repository is already synced with the remote. In the next example, I added the file README.md to the repository on another computer. This time, the output from ‘pull’ looks like: Output from a ‘pull’ when the local repository is behind the remote. This is a successful message. It says that the two repositories have been successfully merged. Finally, a common situation arises where you have not pulled from the remote, have done work locally and committed the changes. It is possible that the remote includes changes that you don’t have, for example commits created by a collaborator and pushed to the same remote repository, or work done by you on another computer. If the remote is ahead of you, and you are trying to push local commits that the remote does not yet have, you will see the output as in the following screenshot. Output when attempting to push to a remote when the remote is ahead of the local repository. The solution to this problem is to first do a pull, and then try to push again. The amazing thing about git is that even if your local commits and the commits on the remote that you don’t yet have include changes on the same files, they will be automatically merged in the new commit. There are cases, however, where conflicts arise - if the local and remote changes are on the same line of text. In that case, you will have to fix the conflicts manually. It is however much better to avoid these conflicts by always beginning your session with a pull, and ending with a push. That way you minimize the risk of changing the same line of code twice. 9.5 Using the command line Rstudio is very convenient for day-to-day version control, but for more advanced options, you must know how to use the command line. You may also find that when you gain more git skills, that using the command line is just as convenient while providing more control. First, we show you how to open the ‘shell’, a command window where the full capabilities of git can be used. From the ‘Git’ tab in Rstudio (same pane as Environment and History), open the Shell like this. The shell is different from the Windows command line! It comes installed with git, and recognizes most unix commands. Note that **if the output is longer than the screen, output will end with a ‘:’. In that case, press q to return to the command prompt}. 9.5.1 Basic commands I will not cover git via the command line in detail here, there are many excellent resources available. Needless to say, everything you can do in Rstudio with a click of a button can be achieved in the command line, and much, much more. Quite useful is a sort of ‘history’, git log which lists each commit (and its SHA and commit message). If you only want to see the last, say 2 commits, do, git log -2 and remember to press q when the output is longer than the window to return to the prompt. 9.5.2 Useful tasks This section lists a number of useful things you can do with git from the command line. It is by no means exhaustive. 9.5.2.1 Adding a remote to a local repository Suppose you have a local project as the example workflow in Section 9.3.1, and you want to start a remote repository. You now simply have to let git know that you have a remote as well. To do this, you have to open a Console (see Section 9.5) and use this command: git remote add origin git@bitbucket.org:remkoduursma/tutorialgit.git where the right-hand side is the address of your remote (found in the last section). Then, make your changes as usual, and use this special push command the first time you push to the remote (after that, you can do the usual simple ‘git push’). git push -u origin master 9.5.2.2 List all tracked files If you are unsure which files are being tracked, you could browse the remote repository (if you have one), or use this command: git ls-files 9.5.2.3 Looking around in an old version Perhaps you don’t actually want to undo changes, but instead inspect some older code, from which you can copy-paste bits you accidentally deleted. We can use the checkout command for this, which let’s you temporarily look at an old commit. First we find the SHA of the commit, either in the history (in Rstudio), or via git log as shown above. git log -2 Now suppose we want to ‘check out’ (look around and browse) the commit with SHA fbd966 (recall, you only ever need the first 5 or 6 characters of the commit). git checkout fbd966 It is crucial you understand that you can now only look around, but you have not reverted to this old version! This is very useful to take a look at old code, maybe copy some bits and pieces to a new file, and then return to the current version. To make sure you know this, git tells you as much: Output of the command line after doing a checkout. Basically git is trying to tell you your visit to this old version of the code is for looking around only. To return back to the current, last version, do: git checkout master 9.5.2.4 Undoing uncommited changes Suppose you have committed your work, then made a bunch more changes that you are very unhappy with. But, luckily, you haven’t committed them yet. You can use the ‘Revert’ button in Rstudio (as mentioned previously), but this really removes any chance that you maybe want to use the new edits. Using the command line, you can use the git stash command as follows: git stash The files will not automatically appear as they were in the last commit. The advantage of using stash here - instead of the Revert button in Rstudio - is that if you change your mind you can do git stash apply. Basically your uncommitted changes are kept in a ‘stash’, not deleted. 9.5.2.5 Deleting the last commit Suppose you have made changes, committed them, and then found out these are terrible and you want to get rid of them. We can use the reset command. Use this at your own risk, it cannot be undone!. First let’s look at the last two commits, git log -2 So we want to get rid of commit f76gb, and revert back to hu88e. git reset --hard hu88e Instead of --hard, you can use the --soft option to revert back to the old commit, but keep the changes since then as unstaged changes to the files. This is useful if you want to keep some of the changes, but manually remove or fix some other changes. 9.5.2.6 Deleting files We already saw that when you delete a tracked file from a git repository, you have to stage the change just like you stage a modification to a file. Here are a couple of useful commands related to deleting files locally. Remove from local repository (i.e. stop tracking) all locally deleted files: git rm $(git ls-files --deleted) The next command is handy to clean your working directory. Use this at your own risk though! Delete all untracked files: git clean -f To do the same, but include subdirectories (use this at even more own risk!): git clean -f -d 9.5.2.7 Searching the history There are a few ways to search the history - all of them require the command line. It may be useful to find code you deleted (on purpose), or to find all the occassions where some word occurs in changed lines of code, or list all the commits that acted on a particular file. Find all commits with ‘someword’ in the commit message. git log --grep=someword Find all commits where ‘someword’ occurs in changed lines of code git log -G someword List all commits that include changes on ‘somefile.R’. This even works when the file was deleted at some point. git log -- somefile.R 9.5.2.8 Accessing git help files You can learn more about the many options of git via the help files, each of these can be accessed like this. Show help file for ‘log’. git log --help Perhaps more usefully, if you don’t know how to do something in git, simply type your question in Google (“git how to delete untracked files”). "],

Although much of this is subject to personal preference, we believe that if you follow these rules, management of your code will be much easier and more transparent: Use ‘projects’ in Rstudio to manage your files and workspace Keep raw (original) data in a separate folder, and never modify raw data Outputs (figures, processed datasets) are disposable, your scripts can always re-produce the output Keep functions separate from other code Write functions as much as possible If you follow (something like) the structure we show here, you have the added benefit that your directory is fully portable. That is, you can zip it, email it to someone, they can unzip it and run the entire analysis. The most important tip is to use projects in Rstudio. Projects are an efficient method to keep your files organized, and to keep all your different projects separated. There is a natural tendency for analyses to grow over time, to the point where they become too large to manage properly. The way we usually deal with this is to try to split projects into smaller ones, even if there is some overlap between them. 10.2 Set up a project in Rstudio In Rstudio, click on the menu item File/New Project.... If you already have a folder for the project, take the 2nd option (Existing directory), otherwise create a folder as well by choosing the 1st option (New project). We will discuss “version control” in the next chapter. Browse for the directory you want to create a project in, and click Choose. This creates a file with extension .Rproj. Whenever you open this project, Rstudio will set the working directory to the location of the project file. If you use projects, you no longer need to set the working directory manually as we showed in Section 2.8. Rstudio has now switched to your new project. Notice in the top-right corner there is a button that shows the current project. For the example project ‘facesoil’, it looks like this: Folder structure; just an example By clicking on that button you can easily switch over to other projects. The working directory is automatically set to the right place, and all files you had open last time are remembered as well. As an additional bonus, the workspace is also cleared. This ensures that if you switch projects, you do not inadvertently load objects from another project. 10.3 Directory structure For the ‘facesoil’ project, we came up with the following directory structure. Each item is described further below. Folder structure; just an example 10.3.1 rawdata Most importantly, keep your raw data separate from everything else. Here we have placed our raw CSV files in the rawdata directory. In some projects it makes sense to further keep raw data files separate from each other, for example you might have subfolders in the rawdata folder that contain different types of datasets (e.g. ‘rawdata/leafdata’, ‘rawdata/isotopes’). Again, the actual solution will depend on your situation, but it is at least very good practice to store your raw data files in a separate folder. 10.3.2 Rfunctions If you do not frequently write functions already, you should force yourself to do so. Particularly for tasks that you do more than once, functions can greatly improve the clarity of your scripts, helps you avoid mistakes, and makes it easier to reuse code in another project. It is good practice to keep functions in a separate folder, for example Rfunctions, with each function in a separate file (with the extension .R). It may look like this, Contents of Rfunctions folder, example. We will use source() to load these functions, see further below. 10.3.3 output It is a good idea to send all output from your R scripts to a separate folder. This way, it is very clear what the outputs of the analysis are. It may also be useful to have subfolders specifying what type of output it is. Here we decided to split it into figures, processeddata, and text : Contents of Rfunctions folder, example. 10.4 The R scripts A few example scripts are described in the following sections. Note that these are just examples, the actual setup will depend on your situation, and your personal preferences. The main point to make here is that it is tremendously useful to separate your code into a number of separate scripts. This makes it easier to maintain your code, and for an outsider to follow the logic of your workflow. 10.4.1 facesoil_analysis.R This is our ‘master’ script of the project. It calls (i.e., executes) a couple of scripts using source. First, it ‘sources’ the facesoil\\_load.R script, which loads packages and functions, and reads raw data. Next, we do some analyses (here is a simple example where we calculate daily averages), and call a script that makes the figures (facesoil_figures.R). Note how we direct all output to the output folder, by specifying the relative path, that is, the path relative to the current working directory. # Calls the load script. source(&quot;facesoil_load.R&quot;) # Export processed data write.csv(allTheta, &quot;output/processeddata/facesoil_allTheta.csv&quot;, row.names=FALSE) ## Aggregate by day # Make daily data allTheta$Date &lt;- as.Date(allTheta$DateTime) allTheta_agg &lt;- summaryBy(. ~ Date + Ringnr, data=allTheta, FUN=mean, keep.names=TRUE) # Export daily data write.csv(allTheta_agg, &quot;output/processeddata/facesoil_alltheta_daily.csv&quot;, row.names=FALSE) ## make figures source(&quot;figures.R&quot;) 10.4.2 facesoil_figures.R In this example we make the figures in a separate script. If your project is quite small, perhaps this makes little sense. When projects grow in size, though, I have found that collecting the code that makes the figures in a separate script really helps to avoid clutter. Also, you could have a number of different ‘figure’ scripts, one for each ‘sub-analysis’ of your project. These can then be sourced in the master script (here facesoil\\_analysis.R), for example, to maintain a transparent workflow. Here is an example script that makes figures only. Note the use of dev.copy2pdf, which will produce a PDF and place it in the output/figures directory. # Make a plot of soil water content over time windows() with(allTheta, plot(DateTime, R30.mean, pch=19, cex=0.2, col=Ringnr)) dev.copy2pdf(file=&quot;./output/figures/facesoil_overtime.pdf&quot;) # More figures go here! 10.4.3 facesoil_load This script contains all the bits of code that are Cleaning the workspace Loading packages Loading homemade functions Reading and pre-processing the raw data Remember that it is important to start with a clean workspace (see Section ??), as it guarantees that all your work is reproducible (and not dependent on objects that you created ages ago). It is useful to load all packages in one location in your, which makes it easy to fix problems should they arise (i.e., some packages are not installed, or not available). # Clean workspace rm(list=ls()) # Load packages library(doBy) library(lubridate) # Source functions (this loads functions but does no actual work) source(&quot;Rfunctions/rmDup.R&quot;) # Make the processed data (this runs a script) source(&quot;facesoil_readdata.R&quot;) 10.4.4 facesoil_readdata.R This script produces a dataframe based on the raw CSV files in the rawdata folder. The example below just reads a dataset and changes the DateTime variable to a POSIXct class. In this script, I normally also do all the tedious things like deleting missing data, converting dates and times, merging, adding new variables, and so on. The advantage of placing all of this in a separate script is that you keep the boring bits separate from the code that generates results, such as figures, tables, and analyses. # Read raw data from &#39;rawdata&#39; subfolder allTheta &lt;- read.csv(&quot;rawdata/FACE_SOIL_theta_2013.csv&quot;) # Convert DateTime allTheta$DateTime &lt;- ymd_hms(as.character(allTheta$DateTime)) # Add Date allTheta$Date &lt;- as.Date(allTheta$DateTime) # Etc. 10.5 Archiving the output In the example workflow we have set up in the previous sections, all items in the output folder will be automatically overwritten every time we run the master script facesoil_analysis.R. One simple way to back up your previous results is to create a zipfile of the entire output directory, place it in the archive folder, and rename it so it has the date as part of the filename. After a while, that directory may look like this: Contents of Rfunctions folder, example. If your processData folder is very large, this may not be the optimal solution. Perhaps the processedData can be in a separate output folder, for example. 10.5.1 Adding a Date stamp to output files Another option is to use a slightly different output filename every time, most usefully with the current Date as part of the filename. The following example shows how you can achieve this with the today from the lubridate package, and paste0 (which is the same as paste, with the argument sep=\"\"). # For the following to work, load lubridate # Recall that in your workflow, it is best to load all packages in one place. library(lubridate) # Make a filename with the current Date: fn &lt;- paste0(&quot;output/figures/FACE_soilfigure1_&quot;,today(),&quot;.pdf&quot;) fn ## [1] &quot;output/figures/FACE_soilfigure1_2019-10-30.pdf&quot; # Also add the current time, make sure to reformat as &#39;:&#39; is not allowed! fn &lt;- paste0(&quot;output/figures/FACE_soilfigure1_&quot;,format(now(),&quot;%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M&quot;),&quot;.pdf&quot;) fn ## [1] &quot;output/figures/FACE_soilfigure1_2019-10-30_20-47.pdf&quot; With the above filename, we can now make a PDF, like so: windows(7,7) # .... make plot here .... dev.copy2pdf(file=fn) "]
